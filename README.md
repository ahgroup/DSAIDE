# DSAIDE
Dynamical Systems Approach to Infectious Disease Epidemiology

## Description
DSAIDE is an R package containing a set of simulations (apps) that teach infectious disease epidemiology from a dynamical system perspective. By manipulating the models through a grahpical user interface and working through the instructions provided for each app, you can learn about some important concepts in infectious disease epidemiology. You will also learn how models can be used to study such concepts.

## Getting Started

For a quick introduction to the package and step-by-step instructions on getting started, [see this package tutorial (vignette)](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIDE/articles/DSAIDE.html).


## Further information
* [I published a paper describing the package and how to use it](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005642). The paper is by now already somewhat outdated whith regards to the details of the package, but it describes the overall idea and context well.  
* A 'companion' package to this one, called Dynamical Systems Approaches for Immune Respone Modeling (DSAIRM), focuses on models for analyzing with-host infection dynamics. It has the same structure as DSAIDE. [See the DSAIRM site for more information.](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIRM)
* I have solutions (as R Markdown files) to most of the 'What to do' tasks for the different apps. If you are an instructor using this package as part of a class, email me if you are interested in having access to these solutions.
