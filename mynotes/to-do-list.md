Things to do for John:

* Do another check. Make sure there are no more references to 'this course' or 'this module' or such. 
* Re-check reproductive number app
* Evolutionary Dynamics App?


Now:
1. Finish vignette, check manual/documentation, improve as needed. 
3. Post package to CRAN, publicize a bit
4. Write DSAIDE paper
5. Write and publish DSAIDE book. Use bookdown, place on leanpub. Then decide if going with a real publisher makes sense.



Add following content/features to package:
* One more app/simulation
* add progress bar
* fix figure size adjustment 
* Left or block align text on main menu page
* Add a 'simulation running' message. This message should go away as soon as the simulation has finished and output has been displayed. Depending on how many lines of code this is, maybe turn it into a stand-alone function. But only do that if it doesn't make the code more complex.

Note: I found a good source of shiny examples and tips and tricks that might be helpful. 
E.g. the ""Busy..." / "Done!" / "Error" example on that website might be useful for the progress bar task below.

- Modify the figure size adjustment functionality such that the width and height can both be adjusted and connect that to the plotOutput() setting in the new version of the UI
