Thoughts on consistent DSAIDE model notation:

Main textbooks are V&W, K&R, Bjornstadt.

We don't want to use greek labels.

VW and KR use b_ij to mean transmission to i from j

KR and BS use gamma for recovery rate

Natural mortality is mu in KR and BS and m in VW

VW use b for birth rate, KR use nu

KR use sigma for latent rate, VW use f



Our notation:
n for birth rate
m for mortality (opposite of what's in there currently)
b for transmission
b_ij for transmission TO i FROM j (opposite of what's in there currently)
g_i for transition rate out of a compartment
w for waning immmunity
