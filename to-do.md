## To-do list for DSAIDE package

* Fix non-displaying of equations when using Rstudio viewer
* Add a 'simulation running' message. This message should go away as soon as the simulation has finished and output has been displayed. Depending on how many lines of code this is, maybe turn it into a stand-alone function. But only do that if it doesn't make the code more complex.
* Improve plot displays, make figures, their look, size and placement better
* Continue streamlining code base to make it more general/modular/flexible
* Left or block align text on main menu page


## Ideas for further apps

* Surveillance app, which has underlying dynamics and observed dynamics, based on clinical status and infection status
* Add pulsed births model (Peel et al 2014) to DSAIDE?

A good source of shiny examples and tips and tricks that might be helpful. E.g. the ""Busy..." / "Done!" / "Error" example on that website might be useful for the progress bar task below: https://github.com/daattali
