#' Simulation of a compartmental infectious disease transmission model with 2 types of hosts
#'
#' @description  This model allows for the simulation of an ID with 2 types of hosts
#'
#'
#' @param S1 : initial number of susceptible type 1 hosts : numeric
#' @param I1 :  initial number of infected type 1 hosts : numeric
#' @param S2 :  initial number of susceptible type 2 hosts : numeric
#' @param I2 :  initial number of infected type 2 hosts : numeric
#' @param b11 :  rate of transmission to susceptible type 1 host from infected type 1 host : numeric
#' @param b12 :  rate of transmission to susceptible type 1 host from infected type 2 host : numeric
#' @param b21 :  rate of transmission to susceptible type 2 host from infected type 1 host : numeric
#' @param b22 :  rate of transmission to susceptible type 2 host from infected type 2 host : numeric
#' @param g1 :  the rate at which infected type 1 hosts recover : numeric
#' @param g2 :  the rate at which infected type 2 hosts recover : numeric
#' @param w1 :  the rate at which type 1 host immunity wanes : numeric
#' @param w2 :  the rate at which type 2 host immunity wanes : numeric
#' @param tmax :  maximum simulation time, units of months : numeric
#' @return This function returns the simulation result as obtained from a call
#'   to the deSolve ode solver.
#' @details A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments
#'   is simulated as a set of ordinary differential
#'   equations. The function returns the output from the odesolver as a matrix,
#'   with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
#' @section Warning:
#'   This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do
#'   something nonsensical (e.g. any negative values or fractions > 1),
#'   the code will likely abort with an error message.
#' @examples
#'   # To run the simulation with default parameters just call the function:
#'   result <- simulate_heterogeneity_ode()
#'   # To choose parameter values other than the standard one, specify them like such:
#'   result <- simulate_heterogeneity_ode(S1 = 100, S2 = 1e3, b11 = 0.7, tmax = 100)
#'   # You should then use the simulation result returned from the function, like this:
#'   plot(result$ts[,"time"],result$ts[,"S1"],xlab='Time',ylab='Number Susceptible 1',type='l')
#' @seealso The UI of the Shiny app 'Host Heterogeneity', which is part of this package, contains more details on the model.
