#' Simulation of a compartmental infectious disease transmission model with 3 types of hosts and intervention
#'
#' @description  This model allows for the simulation of an ID with 3 types of hosts.
#' Groups are assumed to be children, adults and elderly.
#' Intervention can be applied to any of the groups for a certain duration.

#' @return This function returns the simulation result as obtained from a call
#'   to the deSolve ode solver.
#' @details A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments
#'   is simulated as a set of ordinary differential
#'   equations. The function returns the output from the odesolver as a matrix,
#'   with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
#'   The model implement basic processes of infection, recovery and death.
#'   Waning immunity is also implemented.
#'   Treatment is applied, which reduces b by the indicated proportion, during times tstart and tend.
#'   Treatment can be applied at different levels to the different groups.
#'   At time intervals given by tnew, a new infected individual enters each group of the population.
#'   The simulation also monitors the number of infected and when they drop below 1, they are set to 0.
#' @section Warning:
#'   This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do
#'   something nonsensical (e.g. any negative values or fractions > 1),
#'   the code will likely abort with an error message.
#' @examples
#'   # To run the simulation with default parameters just call the function:
#'   result <- simulate_idcontrolmultigroup_ode()
