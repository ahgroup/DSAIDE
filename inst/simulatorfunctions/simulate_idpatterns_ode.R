#' Simulation of a compartmental infectious disease transmission model including seasonality
#'
#' @description  Simulation of a compartmental model with several different compartments:
#'   Susceptibles (S), Infected and Pre-symptomatic (P),
#'   Infected and Asymptomatic (A), Infected and Symptomatic (I),
#'   Recovered and Immune (R) and Dead (D).
#'
#'   This model includes natural births and deaths and waning immunity.
#'   It also allows for seasonal variation in transmission.
#'   The model is assumed to run in units of months.
#'   This assumption is hard-coded into the sinusoidally varying
#'   transmission coefficient, which is assumed to have a period of a year.
#'   
#' @param S : initial number of susceptible hosts : numeric
#' @param P : initial number of infected, pre-symptomatic hosts : numeric
#' @param bP : level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the P compartment : numeric
#' @param bA : level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the A compartment : numeric
#' @param bI : level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the I compartment : numeric
#' @param s : strength of seasonal/annual sigmoidal variation of transmission rate : numeric
#' @param gP : rate at which a person leaves the P compartment : numeric
#' @param gA : rate at which a person leaves the A compartment : numeric
#' @param gI : rate at which a person leaves the I compartment : numeric
#' @param f : fraction of pre-symptomatic individuals that have an asymptomatic infection : numeric
#' @param d : fraction of symptomatic infected hosts that die due to disease : numeric
#' @param w : rate at which recovered persons lose immunity and return to susceptible state : numeric
#' @param m : the rate at which new individuals enter the model (are born) : numeric
#' @param n : the rate of natural death (the inverse it the average lifespan) : numeric
#' @param timeunit : units of time in which the model should run (1=day, 2=week, 3=month, 4=year) : numeric
#' @param tmax : maximum simulation time, in units of months : numeric
#' @return This function returns the simulation result as obtained from a call
#'   to the deSolve ode solver.
#' @details A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments
#'   is simulated as a set of ordinary differential
#'   equations. The function returns the output from the odesolver as a matrix,
#'   with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
#' @section Warning:
#'   This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do
#'   something nonsensical (e.g. have I0 > PopSize or any negative values or fractions > 1),
#'   the code will likely abort with an error message.
#' @examples
#'   # To run the simulation with default parameters just call the function:
#'   result <- simulate_idpatterns_ode()
#'   # To choose parameter values other than the standard one, specify them like such:
#'   result <- simulate_idpatterns_ode(S = 2000, P = 10, tmax = 100, f = 0.1, d = 0.2, s = 0.1)
#'   # You should then use the simulation result returned from the function, like this:
#'   plot(result$ts[ , "time"],result$ts[ , "S"],xlab='Time',ylab='Number Susceptible',type='l')
#' @seealso The UI of the app, which is part of this package, contains more details on the model.
#' @references See e.g. Keeling and Rohani 2008 for SIR models and the
#'   documentation for the deSolve package for details on ODE solvers
