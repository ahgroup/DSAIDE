#' Simulation of a compartmental infectious disease transmission model to study the reproductive number
#'
#' @description  Simulation of a basic SIR compartmental model with these compartments:
#'   Susceptibles (S), Infected/Infectious (I),
#'   Recovered and Immune (R).
#'
#'   The model is assumed to be in units of months when run through the Shiny App.
#'   However as long as all parameters are chosen in the same units,
#'   one can directly call the simulator assuming any time unit.
#'
#' @param S : initial number of susceptible hosts : numeric
#' @param I : initial number of infected hosts : numeric
#' @param b : level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the I compartment : numeric
#' @param g : rate at which a person leaves the I compartment : numeric
#' @param n : the rate at which new individuals enter the model (are born) : numeric
#' @param m : the rate of natural death (the inverse it the average lifespan) : numeric
#' @param w : rate at which recovered persons lose immunity and return to susceptible state : numeric
#' @param tmax : maximum simulation time : numeric
#' @return This function returns the simulation result as obtained from a call
#'   to the deSolve ode solver.
#' @details A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments
#'   is simulated as a set of ordinary differential
#'   equations. The function returns the output from the odesolver as a matrix,
#'   with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
#' @section Warning:
#'   This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do
#'   something nonsensical (e.g. negative values or fractions > 1),
#'   the code will likely abort with an error message.
#' @examples
#'   # To run the simulation with default parameters just call the function:
#'   result <- simulate_reproductivenumber2_ode()
#'   # To choose parameter values other than the standard one,
#'   # specify the parameters you want to change, e.g. like such:
#'   result <- simulate_reproductivenumber2_ode(S = 2000, I = 10, tmax = 100, g = 0.5, n = 0.1)
#'   # You should then use the simulation result returned from the function, like this:
#'   plot(result$ts[ , "time"],result$ts[ , "S"],xlab='Time',ylab='Number Susceptible',type='l')
#' @seealso The UI of the app 'ReproductiveNumber 2', which is part of this package, contains more details on the model.
#' @references See e.g. Keeling and Rohani 2008 for SIR models and the
#'   documentation for the deSolve package for details on ODE solvers
