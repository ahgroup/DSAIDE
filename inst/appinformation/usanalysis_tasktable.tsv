Pay attention to variability in the different quantities reported below the plot. You should see less variability in the central quantities (mean, median) for the larger sample size, extremes (min/max) will continue to fluctuate more.

Reset all values, then set ranges for birth rate to 10 - 20 and death rate range 0.1 - 0.2. Run 50 simulations with random seed at 100. Look at the values at final steady state (and record the one requested).

Now increase the range for the birth rate to 20 - 40. Based on the last task, the final number of susceptible should not change. This is not what you will see, instead the value goes up. Can you figure out why this is the case? As a hint, it has to do with the reproductive number. 

Here is a detailed explanation: Remember (from earlier apps) that the reproductive number for this model is R~0~ = b * S~0~/(g+m). You also learned previously that for this kind of model, in the presence of births and deaths, the steady value for S~0~ is S~0~ = n/m. Combining those 2 equations, you get R~0~ = b * n/((g+m) * m). We can explore the range of possible R~0~ values by using the minimum and maximum of the ranges (we'll just use g=0.5 since the variation is fairly small). Plugging in numbers for the baseline gives a range for R~0~ from 0.005 * 10/((0.5+0.2) * 0.2) to 0.01 * 20/((0.5+0.1) * 0.1), which is rougly 0.35 to 3.3. Thus a good number of samples will have R~0~ < 1 and thus the equation for a steady state in the presence of the disease (i.e. an endemic situation) does not apply. As you increase the birth rate, more values move into the R~0~ > 1 range. The computed average mixes both the R~0~ > 1 samples, for which the steady state equation applies, and those with R0<1, for which that equation does not apply. Therefore, the overall results don't quite make sense. (You can check that in the previous task, parameter ranges were such that all R~0~ values were larger than 1.)

This is an important point. When you sample your parameters, you want to make sure that it doesn't put the model into completely different regimes, otherwise you are combining 2 very different situations and the combined results are hard to interpret. To guard against this, it is often good to sample ranges of parameters in pieces, instead of one very wide range. And it's also always good to explore the outcomes in a plot."

That usually corresponds to biologically unrealistic parameter settings. Obvious silly choices would be ranges that include negative parameter values, but even some non-negative values of individual parameters or combinations of parameters can produce biologically unrealistic outcomes.

"DSAIDE_usanalysis"	"usanalysis"	"Uncertainty and Sensitivity Analysis"	6	"So far, we have changed parameter ranges and explored how that impacts the result. It is often useful to look at the impact of specific parameters on the outcomes of interest in more detail. This is where sensitivity analysis comes in. We run the same simulations, but now instead of plotting outcomes as a boxplot, we produce scatterplots for outcomes as function of each varied parameter. 

Let's explore that. Set values back as in task 1. Switch the plot type from boxplot to scatterplot, choose _b_ as the parameter for the scatterplot, run 50 samples with seed 100. Take a close look at the scatterplots to investigate the relation between the chosen parameter and the various outcomes. To investigate specific parameters, chose them as the output for the scatterplot. Look at the text below the plots. For each parameter-output pair, the code computes a rank correlation coefficient. Numbers close to 0 mean there is essentially no correlation, close to 1 or -1 means a large positive or negative correlation. (One could compute p-values for these correlations, but they are somewhat meaningless since the values will get smaller the more samples you use, so you can basically produce any p-value you want). With more samples, the patterns of correlation are clearer in the plots. Try running the simulation with different sample sizes (50, 100 or even more) to see the impact.
Compare the scatterplots and correlation coefficients with the results you found above, when you explored changes in _b_ and how they affected infected peak.

Now re-run and look at the scatterplots for parameter _m_. From the equation above, we know that larger _m_ means larger _S~final~_. The correlation we find is positive but small.
