But the reproductive number concept is also useful in situations where a disease is endemic. As you learned in the _Patterns of ID_ app (if not, go do it before this one), to achieve an endemic state, we need replenishment of susceptibles through for instance births or waning immunity. We'll start with natural births and deaths. If births (and deaths) are present, you will be able to get multiple outbreaks and endemic states. Set the parameter values such that your hosts have approximately an average lifespan of 41 years (remember to convert to months before taking the inverse). Round to the first significant digit (i.e. 0.00X). Set birth rate such that the population is steady at 1000 in the absence of any infected hosts (if you need a reminder how that's done, revisit the _ID Patterns_ app). 

Now we'll introduce the disease. Set simulation time to around 500 years, 1 infected, _g_=5, _b_=0.015. Run the simulation, make sure you reach a steady state. Compare the steady state values for S (and optional I and R) from the simulation with those predicted from the SIR steady state equations (see _Patterns of ID_ app)."

Let's try that. Go online and find (approximate) values for the duration of the infectious period and _R~0~_ for SARS. Start with 1000 susceptible, 1 infected. Assume that for a single outbreak we can ignore births, deaths or waning immunity (all zer0). Use those values and the _R~0~_ equation to compute the transmission parameter, _b_. Then run a simulation with that value for _b_ (for 12 months). Recall from the _Reproductive Number 1_ app how you can use the fraction if suceptibles left at the end of an outbreak to compute _R~0~_. Do that here again to confirm that you get indeed (approximately) the value you started out with."	"T6R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""
"dsaide_reproductivenumber2"	"reproductivenumber2"	"Reproductive Number 2"	7	"Let's repeat the same for a disease that causes an endemic state, tuberculosis (TB). Go online and find estimates for the basic reproductive number of TB. Note that TB is somewhat special: An infected and infectious person (someone with TB disease) might infect many others, but only some of those will go on to develop disease and become infectious. For R~0~, we always need to go from infectious individual to another infectious individual. Also find an estimate for the duration of the infectious period for TB. Then use these quantities to determine parameters _b_ and _g_ and run a simulation with 1000 susceptible and the same birth and death rates as in task 1 (m=0.002 and n=2). Check that the steady state levels of infected/infectious individuals matches with the R~0~ value you chose.

Note: The SIR model is not a good model for TB since for TB, the stage where individuals are infected but not yet infectious is long and important. So to really model TB, one would need to include such details. We are only using TB here for illustrative purposes."	"T7R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""
