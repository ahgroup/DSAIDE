"dsaide_reproductivenumber2"	"Reproductive Number 2"	"reproductivenumber2"	1	"A) In _Reproductive Number 1_, the focus was on a single outbreak. But the reproductive number concept is also useful in situations where a disease is endemic. As you learned in the _Patterns of ID_ app (if not, go do it before this one), to achieve an endemic state, we need replenishment of susceptibles through for instance births or waning immunity. 
B) We'll start with natural births and deaths. If births (and deaths) are present, you will be able to get multiple outbreaks and endemic states. Set the parameter values such that your hosts have approximately an average lifespan of 41 years. Make sure to convert to months and convert to a rate. Set birth rate such that the population is steady at 1000 in the absence of the ID. Set simulation time to around 500 years, 1 infected, _g_=5, _b_=0.015. Run the simulation, make sure you reach a steady state. Compare the steady state values for S (and optional I and R) from the simulation with those predicted from the SIR steady state equations (see _Patterns of ID_ app)."

To that end, recall its definition and determine what has to be true if the number of infected neither increases nor decreases. You've learned that the equation for the reproductive number for this simple model is R=bS/g. If the reproductive number at steady state is _R~s~_ and we have _S~f~_ susceptibles, then with _S~0~_ susceptibles at the start, what is the basic reproductive number? First do it by simply reasoning from the values of _R~s~_ and _S~f~_ to the values of _R~0~_ and _S~0~_. You can then confirm this by sticking in all parameter values into the _R~0~_ equation."

"dsaide_reproductivenumber2"	"Reproductive Number 2"	"reproductivenumber2"	4	"A) One usually obtains R~0~ from the data/literature and uses it to pick values for the transmission parameter, _b_, which is otherwise very hard to estimate. Let's try that. Go online and find (approximate) values for the duration of the infectious period and R~0~ for SARS. Keep the population size at 1000. Use those values to compute the transmission parameter, _b_. Run a single outbreak (no births and deaths), see if things work out right. Specifically, using the equation involving the final number of susceptibles left should give you an R~0~ that roughly agrees with the one you started out with."	"T4R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""	""	0	0
"dsaide_reproductivenumber2"	"Reproductive Number 2"	"reproductivenumber2"	5	"A) Let's repeat the same for a disease that causes an endemic state, tuberculosis (TB). Go online and find estimates for the basic reproductive number of TB. Note that TB is somewhat special: An infected and infectious person (someone with TB disease) might infect many others, but only some of those will go on to develop disease and become infectious. For R~0~, we always need to go from infectious individual to another infectious individual. Also find an estimate for the duration of the infectious period for TB. Then use these quantities to determine parameters _b_ and _g_ and run a simulation with the same birth and death rates as in task 1. Check that the steady state levels of infected/infectious individuals matches with the R~0~ value you chose.

Note: The SIR model is not a good model for TB since for TB, the stage where individuals are infected but not yet infectious is long and important. So to really model TB, one would need to include such details. We are only using TB here for illustrative purposes."	"T5R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""	""	0	0
