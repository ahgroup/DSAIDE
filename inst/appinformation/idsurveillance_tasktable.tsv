Set the model parameters such that they correspond to the following setting: A population size, _S_, of 1000, 1 initially infected presymptomatic host, _P_, simulation duration _tmax_ = 50 years. Be sure to convert the units to months. Assume that only symptomatic individuals transmit, at rate _bI_ = 0.002. Assume that _gP_ = 5 (the inverse of this parameter is the average duration of the presymptomatic period). Assume that 20% of the infections are asymptomatic--accordingly set _f_ = 0.2. Assume that immunity wanes at a rate _w_ = 1/100. Set the natural death rate, n, to a value that corresponds to an average lifespan of 41 years. Recall that the unit of n needs to be in 1/months. You need to convert lifespan to months, then take the inverse to get the death rate. Round to the first significant digit (i.e. 0.00X). Set the birth rate to _m_ = 5 per month and the death rate _d_ = 0.5. Also assume that no surveillance is done. Accordingly set the surveillance parameters _rP_, _rA_ and _rI_ to zero. With parameters set to correspond to the scenario just described, run the simulation and ensure that you observe oscillations/cycles (i.e. repeated outbreaks). In the diagram for the model, make note of which arrows are present and which are not when you plug in these parameters (for example, the arrows pointing to the 'R' compartment would disappear). Because there is no mechanism for recovery or removal, you should see the number of deaths steadily increase. Additionally, you should see the number of susceptibles oscillate due to the nonzero birth rate parameter."
