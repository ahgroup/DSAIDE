"dsaide_app_24"	"Uncertainty and Sensitivy Analysis"	24	1	"A) Since the creation of parameter samples involves some element of uncertainty, we need to make use of random numbers. We still want results to be reproducible. That's where the random number seed comes in. As long as the seed is the same, the code should produce the same pseudo-random numbers each time, thus ensuring reproducibility. Let's explore this.Leave all settings as they are, run 20 samples twice with the same random number seed, check to make sure you get exactly the same result twice.
B) Now change the random number seed to a different value, run again. You should see results changed. (It doesn't matter if you change the seed by just a bit or a lot.)
C) The more samples you have, the more robust the results are to changes in the underlying sample generation (determined by the random number seed). Try checking this by running 10 samples with 2 different random number seeds, then running 100+ samples (or as many as you can do without waiting too long) with 2 different seeds. You should see less variability in the central quantities (mean, median) for the larger sample size.

**Note** that each sample means one simulation of the underlying dynamical model, so as sample numbers increase, things slow down. Also note the \"system might not have reached steady state message\". If for too many of the samples steady state has not been reached, the results for _S~final~_ and _I~final~_ do not reflect steady-state values. Increasing the simulation time can help the system reach a steady state (if there is one). For some parameter combinations, that can take very long."

"dsaide_app_24"	"Uncertainty and Sensitivy Analysis"	24	4	"A) Continue exploring by changing ranges for different parameters, see what you find. It is likely that for some settings you'll get warning or error messages. That generally means that the parameters for a given simulation are such that the differential equation solver can't properly run the model. That usually corresponds to biologically unrealistic parameter settings. We'll ignore them, but if you did a research project and you got such warning or error messages, you'd have to figure out why you get them and only once you fully understand why is it maybe OK to ignore them."

"dsaide_app_24"	"Uncertainty and Sensitivy Analysis"	24	5	"A) The above approach of exploring the impact of a parameter on results by varying bounds is tedious. Also, often we have bounds that are specified by biology, and not subject to us changing them. It would still be useful to know how a given parameter impacts the results. This is where sensitivity analysis comes in. We run the same simulations, but now instead of plotting outcomes as a boxplot, we produce scatterplots for outcomes as function of each varied parameter.
B) Set values back as in task 1. Switch the plot type from boxplot to scatterplot, run the simulation. Take a close look at the scatterplots to investigate the relation between different parameters and the various outcomes. To investigate specific parameters, chose them as the output for the scatterplot.
C) Look at the text below the plots. For each parameter-output pair, the code computes a rank correlation coefficient. Numbers close to 0 mean there is essentially no correlation, close to 1 or -1 means a large positive or negative correlation. (One could compute p-values for these correlations, but they are somewhat meaningless since the values will get smaller the more samples you use, so you can basically produce any p-value you want). Increase sample size to 100+ or whatever number runs within a reasonable amount of time. With more samples, the patterns of correlation are clearer in the plots.

"dsaide_app_24"	"Uncertainty and Sensitivy Analysis"	24	6	"A) Since our model is rather simple, we can actually determine relations between parameters and some of the outcomes analytically. Specifically, it is possible to compute the steady state values for _S_ and _I_. If you don't know what steady states are and how to compute them, go through the \"patterns of ID\" and/or \"model exploration\" apps, where this is explained.
B) Get the equations for _S_ and _I_ at steady state as determined in those apps. Compare the scatterplots and correlation coefficients with the results from these equations. For instance based on the equation, you should see a linear correlation between _S~steady~_ and death rate _n_.  You might find that there is a lot of scatter in the data, too much to see clear patterns. One could always increase sample size which should help detect patterns, but it takes longer to run. Another option is to restrict the variability to a subset of parameters, which we'll do next."	"T6R9"	"Nothing"	""	""	0	0
"dsaide_app_24"	"Uncertainty and Sensitivy Analysis"	24	7	"A) Let's explore in more detail how different parameters impact results by making the system less 'noisy'. To do so, we can impose no variability for some parameters. For the following parameters, set **both** their lower and upper bound to the specified value: S = 1000, I = 1, b = 0.01, m = 10, n = 0.1.
B) Give _g_ a mean of 1 and variance of 0.1. Run the simulation with 50 samples and produce a scatterplot for _g_. You will see very smooth curves since no other parameters vary. Note the correlation coefficients being essentially -1 or 1.
C) Now increase the 'noise' by also allowing _n_ to vary between 0.1 and 0.5. You will see much 'noisier' plots and the correlation coefficients change. 
D) Look at both scatterplots for _g_ and _n_. Note the different distributions for _g_ and _n_. The former has more points around its mean and less for lower/higher values, while values for _n_ are uniformly distributed along the x-axis. This comes from the underlying assumption about how the parameters are distributed, gamma-distribution versus uniform distribution."	"T7R1"	"Correlation between _g_ and the outbreak peak (Part C).
