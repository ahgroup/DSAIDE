Simulation duration approximately 5 years. Assume that only symptomatic individuals transmit, at rate 0.002. Assume that the duration of the symptomatic period is 1 month long, the duration of the presymptomatic period is half a month long. Assume immunity does not wane and that there are no births and deaths. Set the number of simulations to 1. With parameters set to correspond to the scenario just described, run the simulation.
B) If you rerun the simulation without changing anything, what do you expect to see? Test your expectations by running the simulation several times. To speed things up, set the number of simulations to 20, to run all 20."	"T1R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""	""	0	0

"dsaide_stochasticseir"	"Stochastic SEIR Model"	"stochasticseir"	4	"A) You can mathematically derive an equation linking the probability that an outbreak occurs, _p_, to the reproductive number (see e.g. [@keeling08]). We won't try to do the math here but instead see if we can use the simulation to figure it out. Start with the settings in task 1. Run the stochastic model for b = 0.0002, 0.0003, 0.0004, 0.0005, 0.0006, 0.001, 0.002. For each value, compute R~0~, run the model 100 times, with max time 300 and record the number of times you get an outbreak.
