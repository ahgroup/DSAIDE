"dsaide_idcontrolvaccine"	"Basics of ID Control"	"idcontrolvaccine"	1	"A) Knowing the reproductive number, _R_, is important for control strategies, e.g. for vaccine campaigns. You learned in the reproductive number apps that for _R=1_ an outbreak switches from growth to decline (often called the threshold value). Let's say you have an ID that enters a new population where everyone is susceptible. That ID has R~0~=4. Would you expect to see an outbreak? Why? Now let's assume that we protected half the population through a (100% effective) vaccine. What is the new value for R, i.e. how many people are being infected on average by an infected person after we vaccinated? Is that new value of R low enough to prevent the outbreak? How low does R need to be to prevent an outbreak? What fraction of the population would you need to protect/vaccinate to achieve such an R?"

"dsaide_idcontrolvaccine"	"Basics of ID Control"	"idcontrolvaccine"	2	"A) Let's test the vaccination idea with the computer simulation. Set the simulation with 1000 susceptibles and 1 infected, simulation time 24 months, _g_=5, no births, deaths or waning immunity. Choose the value for _b_ such that _R~0~=4_. Run the simulation for 0% vaccination coverage to confirm things happen as you expect. Check if the final size of the susceptible/infected population is what it should be and returns (approximately) an R~0~=4 when you use the final size equation to compute it. 

B) Now set 50% vaccination coverage at 100% vaccine efficacy (_f=0.5_ and _e=1_). What is the value of the effective _R_ after vaccination? Run a simulation and check to make sure that is what you get. Finally, run the simulation at the vaccination level you determined above to be enough to prevent an outbreak. Make sure your expectations and simulation results agree."	"T2R1"	"Effective _R_ after vaccination (Part B, _f=0.5_)"	"Numeric"	"Report two decimals"	""	0.01	0

"dsaide_idcontrolvaccine"	"Basics of ID Control"	"idcontrolvaccine"	4	"A) Another useful intervention is quarantine, these days more commonly referred to as social distancing. By either forcibly or voluntarily reducing contacts between susceptibles and infected, this can reduce the transmission rate and thus the reproductive number. Consider the scenario as in task 2, but now we have a _b=0.015_. If we were able to reduce contacts and thus transmission by half, would that be enough to prevent an outbreak? By what fraction do we need to reduce the transmission to prevent an outbreak? To answer this, first compute the corresponding _R~0~_. Then confirm with the model. 

Note: In this model, we can't distinguish between interventions that target susceptibles or infected, both could reduce the transmission rate. Targeting susceptibles before they become infected is of course preferable, but there are usually many more of those, so targeting infected is often easier. Interventions that reduce contact and transmission/infection risk for both groups is of course best."
