1	"Knowing the reproductive number, _R_, is important for control strategies, e.g. for vaccine campaigns. You learned in the reproductive number apps that for _R=1_ an outbreak switches from growth to decline (often called the threshold value). Let's say you have an ID that enters a new population where everyone is susceptible. That ID has R~0~=4. Would you expect to see an outbreak? Why? Now let's assume that we protected half the population through a (100% effective) vaccine. What is the new value for R, i.e. how many people are being infected on average by an infected person after we vaccinated? Is that new value of R low enough to prevent the outbreak? What is the minimum percentage of the population you would need to be able to protect/vaccinate to achieve an R such that no outbreak can occur?"

2	"Let's test the vaccination idea with the computer simulation. Set the simulation with 1000 susceptibles and 1 infected, simulation time 24 months, _g_=5, no births, deaths or waning immunity. Choose the value for _b_ such that _R~0~=4_. Run the simulation for 0% vaccination coverage to confirm things happen as you expect. Use the final size equation for R~0~ to make sure it gives you a value of approximately 4."

5	"Most vaccines are not perfect. For the model settings above (R=4), what percentage of the population would you need to vaccinate to prevent an outbreak if the vaccine efficacy/effectiveness was 75% (_e=0.75_)?

6	"Other useful interventions are quarantine or isolation, types of social distancing. Isolation is usually the term applied to reduction of contacts of an infected/infectious individual, quarantine to possibly exposed but likely still susceptible individuals (though that terminololgy can vary). In our model, we can't distinguish between interventions that target susceptibles or infected, both could reduce the transmission rate. Targeting susceptibles before they become infected is of course preferable, but there are usually many more of those, so targeting infected is often easier. Interventions that reduce contact and transmission/infection risk for both groups are of course best.
Consider the scenario as in task 2, but now with _b=0.015_. If we were able to reduce contacts and thus transmission by half, what would _R~0~_ be (and would that prevent an outbreak)?

7	"If we want to completely prevent an outbreak, what value do we need to reduce _R~0~_ to? To achieve this, by what percentage do we need to reduce transmission? Express this reduction as a percent of the original value (e.g. reducing transmission from 0.1 to 0.06 is a (0.1-0.06)/0.1*100 = 40% reduction). Confirm with the model."

8	"Keep exploring. The model allows for births and deaths and waning immunity. We haven't explored that here, but you might want to. One limitation of the model is that it only allows vaccination at the start of the simulation, so any births will always be un-vaccinated. If one wanted a more realistic model, e.g. one that can mimick vaccination of children, one would want to modify the model to allow ongoing vaccination of a fraction of those entering the susceptible compartment."
