Set the recovery rate, _g_, such that it corresponds to an infectiousness duration of 5 days. Set the infectiousness rate _b_ such that the model has a reproductive number, R~0~, of 4. If you don't know how to do that, please work through the _Reproductive Number_ apps first and then come back. Keep the intervention level, _f_, at 0 for now. Set _tmax_ and _tnew_ to 200. Values for _tstart_ and _tend_ do not matter since _f_ is 0. Run the simulation. You should get an outbreak with around 20 susceptibles left at the end."	"T1R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""	""	0	0
"dsaide_idcontrolmultioutbreak"	"ID control for multiple outbreaks"	"idcontrolmultioutbreak"	2	"A) First without running the simulation and using what you know about R~0~ and how it relates to the susceptible population size, figure out what the number of susceptibles is (assuming every other parameter stays the same) at which you don't get an outbreak anymore. Now test your expectation by trying different values for _S_. You might have to adjust the simulation time to see this better. This value for _S_ provides a threshold below which we don't get an outbreak. This directly corresponds to the threshold value for R~0~ which you learned about previously."

"dsaide_idcontrolmultioutbreak"	"ID control for multiple outbreaks"	"idcontrolmultioutbreak"	3	"A) The threshold value below which you do not get an outbreak is around 250 for the parameter settings here. However, in the first task, the number of susceptibles left at the end of the outbreak was much less, around 20. The outbreak 'overshoots' by depleting more susceptibles than the threshold value. Why is that? Think about what happens at the peak of the outbreak when R~0~ switches from being larger than 1 to smaller than 1. Does the outbreak stop immediately? Why not?"

"dsaide_idcontrolmultioutbreak"	"ID control for multiple outbreaks"	"idcontrolmultioutbreak"	4	"A) For a single outbreak, more control is better. We can test that. Using the same number of susceptibles, infected and recovered from __Task 1__. Set control to start at time 0 (_tstart_) and end at 200 (_tend_). Set _tmax_ and _tnew_ both to 200. Slowly increase control, _f_ (e.g. in steps of 0.1). Run the simulation for each value of _f_. As _f_ increases, you should see smaller outbreaks until you hit a value of _f_ for which you don't see outbreaks anymore. Understand how this value of _f_ relates to the reproductive number."

"dsaide_idcontrolmultioutbreak"	"ID control for multiple outbreaks"	"idcontrolmultioutbreak"	5	"A) For multiple outbreaks, more control is not necessarily better. Let's explore that. Set control end to 100 (_tend_). All of the other settings should be the same as the previous task. Slowly increase control, _f_ and run the simulation for the different values of _f_. Initially, things look as before. But once you reach a certain level of control, you will see that a second outbreak occurs and the total number of susceptibles drops again.
B) To explore this in more detail, set f=0.55 and f=0.6 and try to understand why in one case you only get a single outbreak and in the other you get 2. Run the simulation for _f=0.2-0.7_ (in steps of 0.1) and record the number of susceptibles left at the end of the simulation. Based on that, what do you conclude about the impact of different levels of control on the outcome? What seems to be the best level of control, and why?"	"T5R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""	""	0	0
"dsaide_idcontrolmultioutbreak"	"ID control for multiple outbreaks"	"idcontrolmultioutbreak"	6	"A) In the previous task, control ends while there are still a few infected around, which can lead to a second outbreak. An alternative scenario is one where control ends after infected are gone, but then a newly infected person enters the population. We can explore this scenario, as well. Using the same number of susceptibles, infected and recovered from __Task 5__. Set control to start at time 0 (_tstart_) and end at 250 (_tend_), control strength to _f=0.7_. Set _tmax_ and _tnew_ to 500. Run the simulation, you should see a single outbreak with around 686 susceptibles left. 

B) Now set _tnew=300_. That means at time 300 a newly infected individual enters the population. You'll see another outbreak. Make sure you understand why. Try the above again with _f=0.6_. You should see a bigger first and smaller second outbreak. Try the above again with _f=0.5_. This time you will only get one initial outbreak. Compare the number of susceptibles left at the end of the simulation for _f=0.3, 0.5_ and _f=0.7_. Think about why it is again that for some levels of control, you get a single outbreak and for some, you get more than one, and what that means for optimal intervention strength. You should come to the same conclusions as in the previous task."	"T6R1"	"Number of susceptible at the end when _f=0.3_ (Part B)"	"Numeric"	"Report rounded integer"	""	0	0
