"Basic SIR Model"	1	1	"A) Run the simulation with 1000 susceptible individuals and 1 initially infected host, no recovered. Set simulation duration to 100 days, start time and time step can remain at 0 and 0.1. Set recovery rate _g_=0.5 per day, and infectiousness _b_=0.001. You will get an outbreak of some - currently unspecified - infectious disease. If you did it correctly, your outbreak should end with around 203 uninfected individuals still remaining.
B) Also take a look at the final number of infected. You'll see that it is at _3E-9_, i.e. much less than 1 but not 0. That's the issue discussed above in the notes, that for ODE models, numbers can drop below 1, and then can slowly go to 0 but not fully reach 0. Often, this biologically unreasonable feature of these kinds of models can be ignored, but sometimes it matters. You will learn more about this in the apps under the \"Stochastic models\" section."

"Basic SIR Model"	1	2	"A) Switch the plotting to have x-axis, y-axis or both plotted on a log scale. Leave all other settings as before.
C) Note that while the look of the plot changes a lot, nothing has changed about the underlying simulation. The results are exactly the same in each case, only plotted differently. This is something to be aware of when you see plots in papers or produce your own. The best plot to use is the one that shows results of interest in the clearest form. Usually, the x-axis is linear and the y-axis is either linear or logarithmic.
D) Try again switching between ggplot and plotly as plotting engine."	"T2R2"	"Nothing"	""	""	0	0
"Basic SIR Model"	1	3	"A) From the graph, get a (rough) estimate of the day at which the outbreak peaks. That's easiest done when you make a plotly plot.
B) Contemplate the fact that the outbreak ends even though there are still susceptible remaining, i.e. not everyone got infected. Do you find that surprising? How could you maybe explain that? This topic is discussed in more detail in the reproductive number app. 
C) You have no infected left at the end of the outbreak. Figure out how you can use the information from either the susceptibles or recovered left at the end of the outbreak to figure out how many people in total got infected during the outbreak.
D) Rerun the simulation, with the same values you just had. Does anything change? Why (not)?"	"T3R3"	"Day the outbreak peaked"	"Report the rounded integer"	""	1	0

A) Now try different values for _dt_. Leave all other settings as before. You should notice that as _dt_ gets larger, the differences between discrete-time and continuous-time models increase. At some point when the time-step gets too large, the discrete-time simulation 'crashes' and you get an error message. This doesn't impact the continuous/ODE simulation since it chooses its time-step during the simulation internally and _dt_ only affects the times for which the results are returned."

A) Go back to running the ODE model only. Set all parameters as described in task 1. Then double the value of the transmission rate, _b_. Compared to what you found in the previous task, how do you expect the min/max and number/fraction of S/I/R at the end of the outbreak to change? What about the time at which the outbreak peaks? Run the simulation with the doubled transmission rate. Compare your expectations with the results. How do they agree/disagree? Does it make sense? Anything surprising happening?"
