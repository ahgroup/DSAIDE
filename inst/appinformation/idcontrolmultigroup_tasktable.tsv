"dsaide_idcontrolmultigroup"	"ID Control of different populations"	"idcontrolmultigroup"	1	"A) We start by considering an outbreak of something like COVID-19. We assume a population of 1 million individuals, with 20% children, 25% elderly and the remainder middle-aged adults. Set the values for $S_c$, $S_a$ and $S_e$ to reflect these assumptions. We consider rates of transmission to be larger within groups than between groups. We also choose values to have an overall reproductive number of 2. This can be achieved by setting $b_{cc} = 3*10^{-7}$, $b_{ca} = 1.5*10^{-7}$, $b_{ce} = 7.5*10^{-8}$, $b_{ac} = 1.5*10^{-7}$, $b_{aa} = 3*10^{-7}$, $b_{ae} = 1.5*10^{-7}$, $b_{ec} = 7.5*10^{-8}$,  $b_{ea} = 1.5*10^{-7}$, $b_{ee} = 2.25*10^{-7}$. We make the assumption that infection lasts around 10 days in each age group. This means setting the rates $g_i=0.1$. To obtain age-related mortality similar to COVID, we assume mortality risks of 0.1%, 1% and 10% for children, adults and elderly respectively. Set the parameters $m_i$ accordingly. Run the simulation without any control applied, i.e. $f_1 = f_2 = f_3 = 0$. You should see an outbreak with susceptibles at the end of the outbreak at $S_c = 56799$, $S_a = 84498$, $S_e = 75413$ and deaths of $D_c = 143$, $D_a = 4655$, $D_e = 17459$."

"dsaide_idcontrolmultigroup"	"ID Control of different populations"	"idcontrolmultigroup"	2	"A) Now lets implement strong control for each age group by setting $f_1 = f_2 = f_3 = 0.9$. Assume that each control starts 90 days after outbreak start and lasts for 90 days. Keep all other values as previously. Run the simulation. You should see that the strong control initially pushes infected down, but once control is stopped, the outbreak rebounds and the overall size of the outbreak is similar to that without control, with susceptibles at the end of the outbreak at $S_c = 63247$, $S_a = 99107$, $S_e = 83557$ and deaths of $D_c = 137$, $D_a = 4509$, $D_e = 16644$."

"dsaide_idcontrolmultigroup"	"ID Control of different populations"	"idcontrolmultigroup"	3	"A) Now lets implement control that targets mainly children. We also need to apply some control to adults, the largest group, to make the effective reproductive number values comparable. This can be achieved by setting $f_1=1; f_2=0.339; f_3=0$. Assume that each control starts 90 days after outbreak start and lasts for 90 days. Keep all other values as previously. Run the simulation. You should see susceptibles at the end of the outbreak at $S_c = 120683$, $S_a = 159146$, $S_e = 91818$ and deaths of $D_c = 79$, $D_a = 3908$, $D_e = 15817$."	"T3R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""	""	0	0
"dsaide_idcontrolmultigroup"	"ID Control of different populations"	"idcontrolmultigroup"	4	"A) Now lets implement control applied to adults only, in such a way that the effective reproductive number is the same as for the previous task. This can be achieved by setting $f_1=0; f_2=0.475; f_3=0$. Keep all other values as previously. Run the simulation. You should see susceptibles at the end of the outbreak at $S_c = 69000$, $S_a = 181882$, $S_e = 91279$ and deaths of $D_c = 131$, $D_a = 3681$, $D_e = 15871$."	"T4R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""	""	0	0
"dsaide_idcontrolmultigroup"	"ID Control of different populations"	"idcontrolmultigroup"	5	"A) * Now lets implement control that targets mainly the elderly group, again keeping the overall effective reproductive number the same. This can be achieved by setting $f_1=0; f_2=0.318; f_3=1$. Keep all other values as previously. Run the simulation. You should see susceptibles at the end of the outbreak at $S_c = 69988$, $S_a = 157328$, $S_e = 155342$ and deaths of $D_c = 130$, $D_a = 3927$, $D_e = 9465$. Overall, you will find that control applied to the elderly is best in terms of mortality, and beats the strategy of strong control for each group, since still enough get infected to prevent a rebound of the outbreak."
