"DSAIDE_idcontrolmultigroup"	"idcontrolmultigroup"	"Control of Different Populations"	1	"We start by assuming a population of 1000 individuals, with 20% children, 25% elderly and the remainder middle-aged adults. Set the values for _S~c~_, _S~a~_ and _S~e~_ to reflect these assumptions. Start with one infected adult, no infected in the other groups. We make the assumption that infection lasts around 10 days in each age group. This means setting the rates g~i~=0.1. 

If one wanted to run a model for research or policy purposes, one would want to choose transmission rates within and between groups to approximate reality. These transmission rates depend on the pathogen. For respiratory infections, the POLYMOD data is often used (see _Further Resources_ for references). We keep it simple here and assume that rates of transmission within groups is larger than between groups, but that otherwise all groups have the same rates. We'll set b~cc~ = b~aa~ = b~ee~ = 0.0003 (within-group transmission) and all other transmission rates to 0.0001.  

To obtain age-related mortality that mimic COVID-19, we assume mortality among infected to be 0.1%, 1% and 10% for children, adults and elderly respectively. Set the parameters $m_i$ accordingly. Turn off waning immunity for now. Run the simulation without any control applied, i.e. f~1~ = f~2~ = f~3~ = 0 (thus the start and end times for the control do not matter). Run the simulation for 600 days. 

You should see an outbreak with remaining susceptibles in the children/adult/elderly categories of around 75/110/87. Note that for the number of dead children, you get a value below 1. This doesn't make much sense, however, we are running it for a popualtion of 1000 (so we can see the plots well), so interpret this as number per thousand, which can be less than 1. Also compare the final number of recovered to dead and make sure it's approximately the ratio you would expect based on the mortalities for the different age groups."
