To do so, set _b~12~_ to 0 and instead set _b~21~ = 0.001_. If it was just due to cross-transmission, we should probably see outbreaks in both populations.

But it could also be the same hosts. For instance this type of transmission could represent a sexually transmitted disease in a heterosexual population, with the 2 types of hosts being females and males. Many sexually transmitted infections do not produce life-long immunity, re-infection is possible and not uncommon. Let's explore this. Set everything as in the previous task. Then set the number of susceptibles for both populations to 1000 and set b~12~ = 0.001. Then turn on waning immunity, assume it has an average duration of 5 months for each population (i.e. rates _w~1~_ and _w~2~_ need to be the inverse of 5 months. Run the simulation for 10 years).
