To do so, set _b~12~_ to 0 and instead set _b~21~ = 0.001_. If it was just due to cross-transmission, we should probably see outbreaks in both populations. If it was a more infectious/transmissible (i.e. higher _R~0~_) core-group driving the outbreak in the less transmissible group, we should not see an outbreak.

"DSAIDE_hostheterogeneity"	"hostheterogeneity"	"Host Heterogeneity"	8	"You have previously encountered the idea that transmission occurs only between hosts of different types, namely in the vector-borne transmission app. There we thought of the different types as different species, e.g. humans and mosquitoes. But it could also be among different types of the same hosts. For instance this type of transmission could represent a sexually transmitted disease in a heterosexual population, with the 2 types of hosts being females and males. Many sexually transmitted infections do not produce life-long immunity, re-infection is possible and not uncommon. Let's explore this. Set the number of susceptibles for both populations to 1000, 1 infected in each population. Set b~12~ = 0.002, b~21~ = 0.001. Set the other transmission terms to 0. Leave recovery rates as before. Then turn on waning immunity, assume it has an average duration of 5 months for each population (i.e. rates _w~1~_ and _w~2~_ need to be the inverse of 5 months). Run the simulation for 10 years. Confirm that you reach a steady state, with around 667 susceptible of type 1 at the end."
