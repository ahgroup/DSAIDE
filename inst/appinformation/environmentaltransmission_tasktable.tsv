1	"Set the model parameters to the following values. 1000 initially susceptible individuals, 1 initially infected host, no pathogen in the environment, simulation duration 1 year. We'll first look at direct transmission. Set transmission rate of _b~I~ = 0.004_, environmental transmission _b~P~ = 0_. Set environmental pathogen shedding and clearance rates to 0. Assume that the duration of the infectious period is 15 days long (and a month has 30 days). Turn off births and deaths for now. Run the simulation. You should get the usual direct transmission dynamics and a single outbreak. You should be left with around 203 susceptibles at the end of the simulation. Remember that in a model like this, where the only flow from the susceptible class is outflow through becoming infected, everyone who is not in the susceptible compartment at the end has been infected. Thus the total number of infected during the outbreak is the different between susceptibles at the beginning and at the end. Use one of the equations you have learned about in the reproductive number apps to compute $R_0$."

2	"Now try various values for the rate of shedding into the environment, _q_, and environmental clearance _c_. Leave everything else unchanged. As those parameters move away from 0, what do you expect to see? Run the simulation and compare your expectations with the results. Anything surprising happening? Do you understand why you see what you see?"

3	"Now set _q = 100_ and _c = 100_ . Turn off (set to 0) direct transmission. Run to make sure you don't get an outbreak. Now turn on environmental transmission, set it to _b~P~ = 0.004_, the same value you had for direct transmission above. Leave everything else unchanged. Run the simulation. You might or might not find the result surprising. Take a close look at the curves for _I_ and _P_."

4	"In the previous task, removal of pathogens in the environment happened at a rate that was so fast that it essentially tracked whatever was going on in the infected population, and the choice of _q_ and _c_ values were such that that the magnitude of _P_ was the same as _I_. That is generally not the case. Explore a more general scenario by setting _q = 100_ and _c = 50_. Have direct transmission off and environmental transmission as in the previous task. Since decay is now slower, pathogen in the environment builds up to higher levels and produces an overall larger outbreak. Keep exploring how things change for different values of _q_ and _c_."

5	"It is possible to compute the reproductive number for enviromental transmission. Recall that it is defined as the average number of infectious hosts (of 1 type) that are infected by one infectious host of the same type. Here, we need to go through the environment. First, we need to compute _how much environment_ an individual host infects before they recover, and then how many hosts are infected by the environmental pathogen. This can be done as follows: One infected host sheds pathogen for a duration of _1/g_ at a rate _q_, so the total environmental pathogen produced by that host is _q/g_. This amount of pathogen is around for an average time of _1/c_, during which time it infects new hosts at rate $b_P$ for a total production of new infected hosts $b_P/c$. To get the number of new infectious hosts produced by one infectious host, one needs to multiply these two quantities. Then, to get the basic reproductive number, one also needs to multiply by the inital number of susceptible to get $R_0=qb_PS/(gc)$. Use the values from the last task (q=100, c=50) to compute R0 for this simulation. Then use the final-size equation to compute the fraction of susceptible you expect to get for this $R_0$ value and confirm with the simulation."
