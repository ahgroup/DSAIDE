"dsaide_environmentaltransmission"	"Environmental Transmission"	"environmentaltransmission"	1	"A) Set the model parameters to the following values. 1000 initially susceptible individuals, _S~0~_, 1 initially infected host, _I~0~_, no pathogen in the environment (_E~0~_ = 0) , simulation duration, _tfinal_, approximately 5 years. We'll first look at direct transmission. Set transmission rate of _b~D~ = 0.001_, environmental transmission _b~E~ = 0_. Set environmental pathogen shedding, _p_, and clearance, _c_, to 0. Assume that the duration of the infectious period is about 2 months long. Turn off births, _m_, and deaths, _n_, for now. Run the simulation. You should get the usual direct transmission dynamics and a single outbreak. You should be left with around 202 susceptibles at the end of the simulation. Remember that in a model like this, where the only flow from the susceptible class is outflow through becoming infected, everyone who is not in the susceptible compartment at the end has been infected. Thus the total number of infected during the outbreak is the different between susceptibles at the beginning and at the end."

"dsaide_environmentaltransmission"	"Environmental Transmission"	"environmentaltransmission"	2	"A) Now try various values for the rate of shedding into the environment, _p_, and environmental clearance _c_. Leave everything else unchanged. As those parameters move away from 0, what do you expect to see? Think about your expectations, run the simulation and compare your expectations with the results. Anything surprising happening? Do you understand why you see what you see?"	"T2R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""	""	0	0
"dsaide_environmentaltransmission"	"Environmental Transmission"	"environmentaltransmission"	3	"A) Now set _p = 10_ and _c = 10_ . Turn off direct transmission. Run to make sure you don't get an outbreak.
B) Now turn on environmental transmission, set it to _b~E~ = 0.001_. Leave everything else unchanged. What do you expect to see? Run simulations and compare with the direct transmission results."

"dsaide_environmentaltransmission"	"Environmental Transmission"	"environmentaltransmission"	4	"A) Now also turn on direct transmission by setting _b~D~ = b~E~ = 0.001_.

"dsaide_environmentaltransmission"	"Environmental Transmission"	"environmentaltransmission"	6	"A) Try different combinations of direct and environmental transmission only and having only infected hosts or only pathogen in the environment at the start.

"dsaide_environmentaltransmission"	"Environmental Transmission"	"environmentaltransmission"	7	"A) Keep exploring by trying different parameters and transmission settings and see how they influence results. You can also turn on births/deaths and see what you get. As you continue your exploration, think about potential real infectious diseases that might be approximated by either one of the transmission types, and what settings for other model parameters would be for those ID."
