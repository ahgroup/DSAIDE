## Overview {#shinytab1}
For this module, we will explore a simple SIR model with 2 types of hosts. Read about the model in the "Model" tab. Then do the tasks described in the "What to do" tab.

## The Model {#shinytab2}

### Model Overview

This model tracks susceptibles, infected and recovered of 2 different types. Think of those types as e.g. males/females, children/adults, etc. 

The following compartments are included, twice for each type (i=1,2):  

* **S~i~** - uninfected and susceptible individuals 
* **I~i~** - individuals who are infected and infectious.
* **R~i~** - recovered/removed individuals. Those individuals have recovered and are immune. 


The included processes/mechanisms are the following:

* Susceptible individuals of type 1 or 2 can become infected by infected hosts of type 1 or 2. The rates at which infections to type 1/2 from type 1/2 occur are given by the parameters _b~11~_, _b~12~_, _b~21~_ and _b~22~_. 
* Infected hosts of type 1/2 recover after some time at rates _g~1~_/_g~2~_. 
* Recovered individuals are initially immune to reinfection. They can lose their immunity at rates _w~1~_/_w~2~_ and return to the susceptible state. 
 


### Model Implementation
The flow diagram and equations describe the model implemented in this app:

```{r modeldiagram,  fig.cap='',  echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('inst/media',appsettings$modelfigname))
```


$$\dot S_1 = - S_1 (b_{11} I_1 + b_{12} I_2) + w_1 R_1 $$ 
$$\dot I_1 =  S_1 (b_{11} I_1 + b_{12} I_2) - g_1 I_1 $$ 
$$\dot R_1 = g_1 I_1 - w_1 R_1 $$
$$\dot S_2 = - S_2 (b_{22} I_2 + b_{21} I_1) + w_2 R_2 $$ 
$$\dot I_2 =  S_2 (b_{22} I_2 + b_{21} I_1) - g_2 I_2  $$ 
$$\dot R_2 = g_2 I_2 - w_2 R_2 $$




## What to do {#shinytab3}


**The tasks below are described in a way that assumes everything is in units of MONTHS (rate parameters, therefore, have units of inverse months). If any quantity is not given in those units, you need to convert it first (e.g. if it says a year, you need to convert it to 12 months).**

Many sexually transmitted infections do not produce life-long immunity, re-infection is possible and not uncommon. Let's explore this. Set everything as in the previous task. Then set the number of susceptibles for both populations to 1000 and set b~12~ = 0.001.

# tasktext = "You learned that the reproductive number is defined as new infections/infectious hosts of the same type produced by one infectious host. For the case where this is cross-transmission, one can derive it without too much effort. This follows the same reasoning you saw in the vector-borne transmission app. Type 1 infected produce new infections of type 2 at rate _b~21~_ for time 1/g~1~, and if initially all type 2 are susceptible, this leads to a total number of new type 2 infected of _b~21~ S~2~_/_g~1~_. A similar equations holds for the number of type 1 infections produced by a type 2 infected host. The total reproductive number is the product, thus _R~0~_ = _S~1~ S~2~_ _b~21~_ _b~12~_ / (_g~1~ g~2~_). Compute _R~0~_ for the current model settings."

## Further Information {#shinytab4}

* This app (and all others) are structured such that the Shiny part (the graphical interface you see and the server-side function that goes with it) calls an underlying R script (or several) which runs the simulation for the model of interest and returns the results.
* For this app, the underlying function(s) running the simulation are called ``r appsettings$simfunction``. You can call them directly, without going through the shiny app. Use the `help()` command for more information on how to use the functions directly. If you go that route, you need to use the results returned from this function and produce useful output (such as a plot) yourself. 
* You can also download all simulator functions and modify them for your own purposes.  Of course to modify these functions, you'll need to do some coding.
* For examples on using the simulators directly and how to modify them, read the package vignette by typing `vignette('DSAIDE')` into the R console.
* For some more information dealing with host heterogeneity, see e.g. [@beldomenico10, @yorke78, @lloyd-smith05].
