## Overview {#shinytab1}
For this module, we will explore a fairly complex model that allows the study of different types of interventions. Read about the model in the "Model" tab. Then do the tasks described in the "What to do" tab.

### Learning Objectives

* Assess how control applied to different modes of transmission impacts outcomes


## The Model {#shinytab2}

### Model Overview

This model is fairly big and has many parts that can be turned on or off depending on parameter settings. The model allows for 3 types of transmission: direct, through an environmental stage, and through a vector stage. The (human) host is modeled in some detail, the environment and vectors are modeled with 1 and 2 compartments. 
The following compartments are included:  

* **S** - uninfected and susceptible individuals 
* **P** - individuals who are infected and do not yet show symptoms. Those individuals can potentially be infectious
* **A** - individuals who are infected and do not show symptoms. Those individuals can potentially be infectious
* **I** - individuals who are infected and show symptoms. Those individuals are likely infectious, but the model allows to adjust this, including no infectiousness.
* **R** - recovered/removed individuals. Those individuals have recovered and are immune. They can lose their immunity in this model.
* **D** - individuals who have died due to the disease.
* **E** - pathogen in the environment
* **S~V~** - susceptible vectors
* **I~V~** - infected/infectious vectors


The included processes/mechanisms are the following:

* Susceptible individuals (S) can become infected by pre-symptomatic (P), asymptomatic (A) or symptomatic (I) hosts. The rates at which infections from the different types of infected individuals (P, A and I) occur are governed by 3 parameters, _b~P~_, _b~A~_, and _b~I~_. 
* Susceptible individuals (S) can also become infected by contact with the environment or infected vectors, at rates _b~E~_ and _b~v~_. 
* Susceptible vectors (S~v~) can become infected by contact with symptomatic hosts at rate _b~h~_. 
* All infected hosts first enter the presymptomatic stage. They remain there for some time (determined by rate _g~P~_, the inverse of which is the average time spent in the presymptomatic stage). 
A fraction _f_ of presymptomatic hosts move into the asymptomatic category, and the rest become symptomatic infected hosts.
* Asymptomatic infected hosts recover after some time (specified by the rate _g~A~_). Similarly, the rate _g~I~_ determines the duration the symptomatic hosts stay in the symptomatic state. For symptomatic hosts, two outcomes are possible. Either recovery or death. The parameter _d_ determines the fraction of hosts that die due to disease.
* Recovered individuals are initially immune to reinfection. They can lose their immunity at rate _w_ and return to the susceptible compartment. 
* Symptomatic and asymptomatic hosts shed pathogen into the environment at rates p~A~ and p~I~. The pathogen in the environment decays at rate _c_.
* New susceptible hosts and vectors enter the system (are born) at rates _n~h~_ and _n~v~_. Mortality (death unrelated to disease) for hosts and vectors occurs at rates _m~h~_ and _m~v~_.

Note that we only track people that die due to the disease in our _D_ compartment. All hosts dying due to other causes just "exit the system" and we don't further keep track of them (though we could add another compartment to "collect" and track all individuals who died from non-disease-related causes.)

Also, note that we made several simplifications to keep the model from getting too complex. For instance, presymptomatic individuals do not shed into the environment, and only symptomatic hosts are assumed to be able to infect vectors. Further details relaxing these assumptions could, of course, be included, at the expense of a larger and more complex model.


### Model Comments

In the _Environmental Transmission_ app, I used _P_ for pathogen in the environment, but here I'm using _E_ since _P_ is used for pre-symptomatic. One could as well switch things around and use _E_ for exposed (instead of my _P_) and then _P_ for pathogen in environment. I decided to leave it as is. It's good to get used to different notation. 

I also decided for simplicity to not give the human compartments (or the environmental pathogen) any subscripts, so no subscript means human, if a compartment has a subscript it refers to vectors (i.e. _S~v~_ and _I~v~_).

Another point worth mentioning are the transmission terms. I generally use a single subscript to describe transmission from a group, e.g. _b~A~_ for transmission/infectiousness of asymptomatic. If there are multiple groups that can be susceptible and infectious, a common notation is to start with the **receiving** group first, then the **sending/transmitting group**, e.g. if susceptible adults (A) are infected by children (C), most authors write _b~AC~_. I follow this convention. Note however that it is equally ok to use _b~AC~_ to mean that infected adults transmit to susceptible children. I actually like this _sender first_ perspective better, and used it originally, but switched to stick with the convention used in the main introductory textbooks on this topic. 

**In general you need to read papers/model descriptions carefully, and hopefully the authors do a good job explaining exactly what is meant. Such that there is no confusion. Just read carefully every time and don't jump to conclusions based on what you have seen before or what you think it means.**




### Model Implementation
The flow diagram and equations describe the model implemented in this app. Note that births and natural deaths are not drawn to keep the diagram from getting too cluttered.


```{r modeldiagram,  fig.cap='Flow diagram for this model.',  echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('inst/media',appsettings$modelfigname))
```


$$\dot S = n_h - S (b_P P + b_A A + b_I I + b_E E + b_v I_v) + wR - m_h S $$ 
$$\dot P = S (b_P P + b_A A + b_I I + b_E E + b_v I_v) - g_P P - m_h P$$ 
$$\dot A = f g_P P - g_A A - m_h A$$ 
$$\dot I = (1-f) g_P P - g_I I - m_h I $$ 
$$\dot R = g_A A + (1-d) g_I I - wR - m_h R$$
$$\dot D = d g_I I $$
$$\dot E = p_I I + p_A A - c  E $$
$$\dot S_v = n_v  - b_h  I  S_v - m_v  S_v $$ 
$$\dot I_v = b_h I S_v - m_v  I_v $$ 
    




## What to do {#shinytab3}

### Notes

**The tasks below are described in a way that assumes everything is in units of MONTHS (rate parameters, therefore, have units of inverse months). If any quantity is not given in those units, you need to convert it first (e.g. if it says a year, you need to convert it to 12 months).**

_Some of the simulations might take a few seconds to run. Be patient._

Since we haven't turned on transmission from the environment yet, the outbreak size should be the same as in task 1. Now set bE=0.0005. You will see a larger outbreak (less susceptible hosts remaining) and also higher levels of E. Why do you see a larger outbreak and more E now? Think about how the pathogen moves through the system.

Again, if you are up for an optional challenge and work on your R~0~ skills, determine R~0~ for this scenario. You can use the discussion in the _Environmental Transmission_ app to guide you. Since here we have transmission both through environment and direct transmission, R~0~ will be the sum of transmission coming from all 3 infected compartments (P, A, I) and the environement E.

We didn't explore impact of disease-induced death, waning immunity, or presence of all three modes of transmission (though I'm not sure what ID that would apply to). All of those settings, and the impact of different interventions, could be explored. If you have a favorite pathogen, you could try to set parameters in this model to mimic it and explore different interventions and their impact."

## Further Information {#shinytab4}


* This app (and all others) are structured such that the Shiny part (the graphical interface you see and the server-side function that goes with it) calls an underlying R script (or several) which runs the simulation for the model of interest and returns the results.
* For this app, the underlying function(s) running the simulation are called ``r appsettings$simfunction``. You can call them directly, without going through the shiny app. Use the `help()` command for more information on how to use the functions directly. If you go that route, you need to use the results returned from this function and produce useful output (such as a plot) yourself. 
* You can also download all simulator functions and modify them for your own purposes.  Of course to modify these functions, you'll need to do some coding.
* For examples on using the simulators directly and how to modify them, read the package vignette by typing `vignette('DSAIDE')` into the R console.
* For some additional reading, see e.g. [@klepac13, @klepac15, @kirsch17, @tognotti13].
