## Overview {#shinytab1}
This app explores how one should implement ID control measures for a scenario with multiple consecutive outbreaks. Read about the model in the "Model" tab. Then do the tasks described in the "What to do" tab. Before going through this app, you should go through the _Reproductive Number_ apps first. This app closely follows a model and analysis described in [@handel07a], see the "Further Information" tab for this and other related references.

### Learning Objectives
* Understand the concept of susceptible threshold level and how it relates to population immunity and the reproductive number.
* Learn what 'overshoot' is and how it happens in infectious disease interventions.
* See how optimal control measures for multiple outbreaks can differ from those for a single outbreak.


## The Model {#shinytab2}

### Model Overview
For this app, we'll use the basic compartmental SIR model. We include 3 different stages/compartments: 

* **S** - uninfected and susceptible individuals 
* **I** - infected and infectious individuals
* **R** - recovered/removed individuals

For this app, we specify the following processes/flows: 

* Susceptible individuals (S) can become infected by infectious individuals (I) at some rate, _b_. This leads to the susceptible individual leaving the S compartment and entering the I compartment.   
* Infected individuals recover and enter the recovered (R) compartment at some rate, _g_.
* Control measures are applied at some level _f_ (between 0 and 1) which reduces the rate at which new infections occur. Control measures start at time _tstart_ and end at time _tend_. The parameter _f_ can be non-zero outside of the treatment interval given by _tstart_ and _tend_. What _f_ does is to reduce the transmission rate by a certain fraction, e.g. f=0.5 means the rate of transmission is reduced to _0.5b_. We do not specify the intervention here by which this reduction is achieved, it can be many types of interventions.
* To mimic the process of new infected individuals arriving in a specific location, at intervals _tnew_, the number of infected increases by 1. 

### Model Implementation
The flow diagram and the set of equations which are used to implement this model are as follows:

```{r modeldiagram,  fig.cap='Flow diagram for this model. ',  echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('inst/media',appsettings$modelfigname))
```



$$\dot S = -(1-f) b SI$$ 
$$\dot I = (1-f)b S I$$
$$\dot R = g I$$


The simulation for this app also has one more (mostly invisible) feature. In previous apps, you learned that an unrealistic feature of models implemented by ordinary differential equations (ODE) is that the number of individuals can drop below 1, i.e., there could be a fraction of infected. For this app, the underlying code is such that if the number of infected drops below 1, it is set to 0. This is in some way a bit of a "hack" to deal with this issue. When you work through the stochastic apps, you will learn better ways of handling this. The advantage of using the "hack" is that we can keep using the ODE model formulation, without stochasticity, which makes things easy.



## What to do {#shinytab3}

__This app assumes knowledge of the reproductive number concept. If you are not familiar with it, please go through the 'Reproductive Number' apps first.__

_The tasks below are described in a way that assumes everything is in units of **days** (rate parameters, therefore, have units of inverse days). If any quantity is not given in those units, you need to convert it first._

Keep the intervention level, _f_, at 0 for now. Set _tmax_ and _tnew_ to 100. Values for _tstart_ and _tend_ do not matter since _f_ is 0. Run the simulation.

Let's explore a bit more how to apply optimal control if there is a chance of multiple outbreaks, either because the pathogen did not get completely wiped out in a specific community, or there are ongoing re-introduction of the pathogen from the outside. Set control to start at time 10 and end at 50. Assume no new infected persons enter the population by setting both total simulation time and _tmax_ and _tend_ to 200 days. All of the other settings as in the previous task. Slowly increase control, _f_ and run the simulation for the different values of _f_. Initially, things look as before. But once you reach a certain level of control, you will see that a second outbreak occurs and the total number of susceptibles drops again. To explore this in more detail, set f=0.6 and f=0.7 and try to understand why in one case you only get a single outbreak and in the other you get 2. To get the values for susceptible at t=50 it is easiest to switch to a plotly plot and read them off.

You should see a single outbreak with around 475 susceptibles left. You learned above that this value of is not low enough for herd immunity, thus you can get a second outbreak. This is not happening here since the infected dropped to 0, so when control is ended, there is no chance a new outbreak can start. However, that changes if newly infected enter the population. To simulate this, set _tnew=50_, then run the simulation again. A new infected person is no introduced every 50 days. At times 50 and 100, control is still in effect, so they have no impact.

This can be accomplished in different ways. Play around with start- and end-times for control and control strength to explore ways you can minimize the outbreak. You can also alter transmission or recovery rate to change _R~0~_ and see how that changes results. An option that is not possible with this simulation but could be done in real life is adaptive control by changing the control strength. You could mimic it by running a simulation with control at some level, then use the end values of the simulation as starting values with new control, etc. That's a bit tedious to do through the graphical interface but would not be too hard if you interacted with the simulation function directly through code."

## Further Information {#shinytab4}
* This app (and all others) are structured such that the Shiny part (the graphical interface you see and the server-side function that goes with it) calls an underlying R script (or several) which runs the simulation for the model of interest and returns the results.
* For this app, the underlying function(s) running the simulation are called ``r appsettings$simfunction``. You can call them directly, without going through the shiny app. Use the `help()` command for more information on how to use the functions directly. If you go that route, you need to use the results returned from this function and produce useful output (such as a plot) yourself. 
* You can also download all simulator functions and modify them for your own purposes.  Of course, to modify these functions, you'll need to do some coding.
* For examples on using the simulators directly and how to modify them, read the package vignette by typing `vignette('DSAIDE')` into the R console.
* This app closely follows a model and analysis described in [@handel07a]. Similar ideas applied to drug sensitive and drug-resistant influenza strains are discussed in [@lipsitch07; @alexander07; @handel09a].
