## Overview {#shinytab1}
This app explores how one should implement ID control measures for an scenario with multiple consecutive outbreaks. Read about the model in the "Model" tab. Then do the tasks described in the "What to do" tab. Before going through this app, you should go through the 'Reproductive Number' apps first.

### Learning Objectives
* Understand the concept of susceptible threshold level and how it relates to population immunity and the reproductive number.
* Learn about the idea of 'overshoot'.
* Know how optimal control measures for multiple outbreaks can differ from a those for a single outbreak.


## The Model {#shinytab2}

### Model Overview
For this app, we'll use the basic compartmental SIR model. We include 3 different stages/compartments: 

* **S** - uninfected and susceptible individuals 
* **I** - infected and infectious individuals
* **R** - recovered/removed individuals

For this app, we specify the following processes/flows: 

* Susceptible individuals (S) can become infected by infectious individuals (I) at some rate, _b_. This leads to the susceptible individual leaving the S compartment and entering the I compartment.   
* Infected individuals recover and enter the recovered (R) compartment at some rate, _g_.
* Control measures are applied at some level _f_ (between 0 and 1) which reduces the rate at which new infections occur. Control measures start at time _tstart_ and end at time _tend_.
* A new infected person enters the population at fixed time intervals given by _tnew_.

### Model Implementation
The flow diagram and the set of equations which are used to implement this model are as follows:

```{r multioutbreakdiagram,  fig.cap='Flow diagram for this model. ',  echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../media/multioutbreakmodelfigure.png")
```



$$\dot S = -(1-f) b SI$$ 
$$\dot I = (1-f)b S I$$
$$\dot R = g I$$

where _f_ is zero outside of the treatment interval given by _tstart_ and _tend_. Further, at intervals _tnew_, the number of infected increases by 1.



## What to do {#shinytab3}


**The tasks below are described in a way that assumes everything is in units of days (rate parameters, therefore, have units of inverse days). If any quantity is not given in those units, you need to convert it first.**


### Task 1 
* Set the model to 1000 initial susceptible, 1 infected, no recovered.
* Set the recovery rate, _g_, such that it corresponds to a infectiousness duration of 5 days.  
* Set the infectiousness rate _b_ such that the model has an R~0~ of 4.
* Keep the intervention level, _f_, at 0 for now.
* Set _tmax_ and _tnew_ to 200. Values for _tstart_ and _tend_ do not matter since _f_ is 0.
* Run the simulation. You should get an outbreak with around 20 susceptibles left at the end.


### Task 2 
* First without running the simulation and using what you know about R~0~ and how it relates to the susceptible population size, figure out what the number of susceptibles is - assuming every other parameter stays the same - at which you don't get an outbreak anymore. 
* Now test your expectation by trying different values for _S_. You might have to adjust the simulation time to see this better.

This value for _S_ provides a threshold below which we don't get an outbreak. This of course directly corresponds to the threshold value for R~0~ which you learned about previously. 

### Task 3 
The threshold value below which you do not get an outbreak is around 250 for the parameter settings here. However, in the first task the number of susceptibles left at the end of the outbreak was much less, around 20. The outbreak 'overshoots' by depleting more susceptibles than the threshold value. Why is that? Think about what happens at the peak of the outbreak when R~0~ switches from being larger than 1 to smaller than 1. Does the outbreak stop immediately? Why not? 

### Task 4 
For a single outbreak, more control is better. We can test that.

* Set everything back to task 1, but increase simulation time to 500. 
* Set control start at 0 and end at 500.
* Slowly increase control, _f_. Run the simulation for each. As _f_ increases, you should see smaller outbreaks until you hit a value of _f_ for which you don't see outbreaks anymore. Understand how this value of _f_ relates to the reproductive number.

### Task 5 
For multiple outbreaks, more control is not better. Let's explore that.

* Set everything as in the previous task, but set control end to 200.
* Slowly increase control, _f_. Run the simulation for each. Initially, things look as before. But once you reach a certain level of control, you will see that a second outbreak occurs and the total number of susceptibles drops again.
* To see explore this in more detail, set f=0.55 and f=0.6 and try to understand why in one case you only get a single outbreak and in the other you get 2.


## Further Information {#shinytab4}
* This app (and all others) are structured such that the Shiny part (the graphical interface you see and the server-side function that goes with it) calls an underlying R script (or several) which runs the simulation for the model of interest and returns the results.
* For this app, the underlying function(s) running the simulation are called ``r appsettings$simfunction``. You can call them directly, without going through the shiny app. Use the `help()` command for more information on how to use the functions directly. If you go that route, you need to use the results returned from this function and produce useful output (such as a plot) yourself. 
* You can also download all simulator functions and modify them for your own purposes.  Of course to modify these functions, you'll need to do some coding.
* For examples on using the simulators directly and how to modify them, read the package vignette by typing `vignette('DSAIDE')` into the R console.
* This app closely follows a model and analysis described in [@handel07a]. Similar ideas applied to drug sensitive and drug resistant influenza strains are discussed in [@lipsitch07; @alexander07; @handel09a].
