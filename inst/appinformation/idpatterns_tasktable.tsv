Assume that only symptomatic individuals transmit, at rate _b~I~_ = 0.002 and that there is no seasonal variation (s=0). Assume that the duration of the symptomatic period is 1 month long. (Hint: The parameter _g~I~_ is the inverse of this period.) Assume that the duration of the presymptomatic period is approximately 6 days long. (Make sure you convert units correctly. First convert from days to months. You can assume that a month is roughly 30 days. Then take the inverse to get the rate.) Assume that there are no asymptomatic infections. You can, therefore, set the rate of recovery of asymptomatics, _g~A~_ to anything, it doesn't matter because nobody will be asymptomatic. Assume nobody dies due to disease, immunity does not wane, no births, and no natural deaths. If you did it correctly, you should get a single outbreak with around 203 susceptibles left at the end."

"dsaide_idpatterns"	"idpatterns"	"ID Patterns"	2	"Next, turn on births and deaths. It's always good to check parts of a model. Here, we want to first look at births and deaths in the absence of disease. Therefore, set initial number of presymptomatic to 0, keep the number of susceptible at 1000. Set the natural mortality rate, _m_, to a value that corresponds to an average lifespan of 41 years. Recall that the unit of _m_ needs to be in 1/months. You need to convert lifespan to months, then take the inverse to get the death rate. Round to the first significant digit (i.e. 0.00X). Set the birth rate to _n=4_ per month. Also increase the simulation duration to 500 years (make sure to convert to months). (Depending on the speed of your computer, it will take several seconds for the simulation to finish). Set the initial number of pre-symptomatic individuals to 0. This means there are no infected, and thus no transmission can happen. We are focusing on only the susceptibles. Run the simulation, record the number of susceptibles at the end. Repeat this for different starting values of S, you should always end up at the same final value. It is possible to compute this final value from the equations. In the absence of disease, all infection related states (P, A, I) are zero and the equation for the susceptibles becomes $dS/dt=n-mS$. S settles down to a state where there is no more change, the so-called steady state. At that state, we have $dS/dt=0=n-mS$. You can now solve this equation for _S_ as a function of the parameters _m_ and _n_. Do that, then stick in the values for the parameters you just used to run the simulation, and convince yourself that the _S_ you get doing the math and the value you get from running the simulation are the same (up to some rounding error)."

We do that because we don't want a mixing of underlying population growth/decline dynamics on top if the ID dynamics. That would make it more complicated to understand what's going on. (You get to do that later). Ensure that if you run the simulation now, nothing changes, i.e. the susceptibles remain at the same number. Now introduce an infected individual (_P0=1_), with other values as set in task 1. Set the simulation duration to 200 years. What do you expect to see? Run the simulation, compare expectations with results. If things work right, you should see around 501 susceptibles at the end of the simulation."	"T4R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""
"dsaide_idpatterns"	"idpatterns"	"ID Patterns"	5	"It is possible to compute the steady state values for the model variables at the endemic scenario, i.e. when the number of infected is non-zero. This computation is a bit messy for the model above because it has the extra _P_ and _A_ states that make the math more complicated (you can try for yourself as a challenge after you've done the simple model.) To keep the math simpler, we consider a simplified approximation of the above model. The way we have set our parameters so far, individuals spend a very short time in _P_ compared to _I_. We can thus approximately ignore the _P_ compartment and assume that individuals go directly from _S_ to _I_. Further, for our parameter choices, nobody enters _A_ and _D_, so we can ignore those compartments too. This produces the following simpler SIR model:

$$ dS/dt = n -   b_I IS - m S $$ 
$$ dI/dt = b_I SI - g_I I - m I $$ 
$$ dR/dt =  g_I I  - m R $$

We can follow the procedure above for computing the steady state for _S_ to compute the endemic steady state by setting the left side of the equations to 0 and solving for the variables _S_, _I_ and _R_ as functions of model parameters only. Try it. You should get _S=(g~I~ + m)/b~I~ _ and similar equations for _I_ and _R_. For more on steady state calculations, see e.g. [@vynnycky10] or [@keeling08] (but note that each of those references uses their own notation which is not quite the same as used here.) Compare the model simulations with the equations you found. Substitute the parameter values from the task above into the equations you found for _S_, _I_ and _R_ and confirm that you get approximately the same results as you get from running the model to steady state.

To get an exact match between simulation and math would require solving the full model (i.e. the one that includes _P_ and _A_ as shown in the _Model_ tab. But those equations are getting big and ugly. If you want to give it a try, I recommend using software that can solve such equations analytically. The free [Maxima software](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/) might be a good option. If you have access to it, Mathematica or Maple are other good choices."	"T5R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""

"dsaide_idpatterns"	"idpatterns"	"ID Patterns"	7	"We can again compare the steady state values we get from the simulation with those we get from a model. To do so, we follow the approach above. The model we now solve is one that doesn't include births and deaths but does including waning immunity. The equations are:

$$ dS/dt = w R  -   b_I IS $$ 
$$ dI/dt = b_I SI - g_I I $$ 
$$ dR/dt =  g_I I  - W R $$

You can set the left sides to zero and solve for the steady states of _S_, _I_ and _R_. By solving the second equation for _S_, you will find that its steady state is independent of _w_, which you should have also seen in your simulations. _I_ and _R_ are not uniquely determined, you'll realize you can't solve them as before.

Now run the model with increasing seasonality by setting s = 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.

Start with no seasonal variation, i.e. _s=0_. You should see one decent outbreak with a peak at around 10 months, another small one with a peak at around 30 months, and not much else (you might want to use plotly so you can easier zoom in/out). Now set seasonal variation strength to _s=0.5_. You should see that the outbreaks keep going now. Approximately how many months are there between outbreak peaks?

To that end, run simulations with _s=0.5_ and _w=0.2_ and _w=0.05_. You can further explore by switching off waning immunity and turning on births and deaths instead. You can also have both mechanisms present and explore how they interact with seasonality. And of course, you can set parameters to allow for asymptomatic infections and deaths, ore have an underlying growing or declining population in the absence of disease and let the disease run on top of it. There is lots to explore. While it can be fun running simulations with random parameters, I suggest you learn more if you are deliberate in your explorations. After you set the model inputs to some values and before you run a simulation, think about what you expect. Then run and compare results with expectations. If they don't agree, try to figure out what's going on.
