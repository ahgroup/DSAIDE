## Overview {#shinytab1}
This app lets you explore a stochastic SEIR model. Read about the model in the "Model" tab. Then do the tasks described in the "What to do" tab.

For this app, it is assumed that you've worked through all the ones in the _Basics_ and _Reproductive Number_ sections, as well as the _Stochastic SIRS_ one.

### Learning Objectives
* Obtain further familiarity with stochastic compartmental models
* Learn about steady states in stochastic models
* Explore extinctions

## The Model {#shinytab2}

### Model Overview

This model tracks susceptibles, exposed/pre-symptomatic, infected/symptomatic and recovered hosts. 
The following compartments are included:  

* **S** - uninfected and susceptible individuals 
* **E** - individuals who are infected and do not yet show symptoms. Those individuals can be infectious.
* **I** - individuals who are infected and show symptoms. Those individuals are likely infectious, but the model allows to adjust this, including no infectiousness.
* **R** - recovered/removed individuals. Those individuals have recovered and are immune. They can lose their immunity.


The included processes/mechanisms are the following:

* Susceptible individuals (S) can become infected by pre-symptomatic/exposed (E) or symptomatic (I) hosts at rates _b~E~_ and _b~I~_. 
* All infected hosts first enter the exposed/presymptomatic stage and leave the stage at rate _g~E~_, the inverse of which is the average time spent in this stage. 
* All infected hosts go from the presymptomatic to the symptomatic stage and leave the stage at rate _g~I~_. 
* Recovered individuals are initially immune to reinfection. They can lose their immunity at rate _w_ and return to the susceptible compartment. 
* New susceptible hosts enter the system (are born) at fixed rate _n_. Natural death occurs at rate _m_.



### Model Implementation
The flow diagram for the model implemented in this app is:

```{r modeldiagram,  fig.cap='',  echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('inst/media',appsettings$modelfigname))
```

The deterministic/ODE equations for this model are:

$$\dot S = n - S (b_E E + b_I I) - mS + wR$$ 
$$\dot E = S (b_E E + b_I I)  - g_E E - m E$$
$$\dot I = g_E E - g_I I - m I $$
$$\dot R = g I - mR - wR$$

However, for this app we do __not__ implement a deterministic/ODE model. Instead, we implement its stochastic equivalent.
We can specify the model by writing down every possible transition/event/reaction that can occur and their propensities (the propensity multiplied with the
time step gives the probability that a given event/transition occurs). For our model these are the following:

Event type              |  Transitions        |   Propensity      |
----------              |  -----------        |   ----------      |
Infection               |  S => S-1, E => E+1 |   S(b~E~E+b~I~I)  |
Progression to Symptoms |  E => E-1, I => I+1 |   g~E~E           |
Recovery                |  I => I-1, R => R+1 |   g~I~I           |
Waning of Immunity      |  R => R-1, S => S+1 |   wR          |
Births                  |  S => S+1           |   n          |
Death of susceptible    |  S => S-1           |   mS          | 
Death of exposed        |  E => E-1           |   mE          |
Death of symptomatic    |  I => I-1           |   mI          |
Death of recovered      |  R => R-1           |   mR          |




## What to do {#shinytab3}

**The tasks below are described in a way that assumes everything is in units of MONTHS (rate parameters, therefore, have units of inverse months). If any quantity is not given in those units, you need to convert it first (e.g. if it says a year, you need to convert it to 12 months).**

_Some of the simulations might take a few seconds to run. Be patient._

Run the simulation, you should find that the system settles to some kind of stochastic version of a steady state, namely S-E-I-R values that fluctuate around some level. Note that there is still a mix of simulations that did and didn't produce an outbreak. In fact, that number of simulations that produce an outbreak dropped from 5 to 4. Just by chance the inclusion of waning immunity meant that processes in the model got executed differently at the start of the simulation and a simulation that took off earlier now didn't. Let's - just for fun - look into that more closely and see if we can identify the simulation. To that end, set the number of simulations to run to 1, start with random seed 123, no waning immunity. Run the simulation. You'll see that this produces no outbreak. We want to find the one that produces an outbreak in the absence of waning immunity and does not with waning immunity turned on. So let's move to the next one, run the simulation for random seed 124 (remember from the previous app that if you run 10 simulations, internally the seed is increased each time). Again no outbreak, so let's do 125. You'll see an outbreak. Now turn on waning immunity see if you still get an outbreak (you will). Keep trying the random seeds (up to 132) until you find the seed for which you get an outbreak without waning immunity but none with waning immunity. Note that this has nothing directly to do with the waning immunity process, it just happens to mix up the random numbers in the simulation that now we don't get an outbreak."

You can see that the reported final value for the susceptibles does not agree with what you see for those simulations which have a steady-state like scenario with non-zero infected. That's because the average includes also those scenarios where no outbreak happened. Essentially, the average is computed here by doing 6/10*1000 (simulations without an outbreak) + 4/10*Sfinal_outbreak (simulations with outbreak), where Sfinal_outbreak is the average value of susceptibles at the end of the simulation for those scenarios where you get an outbreak.

You should find an average of around 133 infected at the end. While there is no guarantee that the average of the stochastic model agrees with an equivalent deterministic model for the types of (nonlinear) models we are exploring, they are often close. We can check that by computing the steady states for the deterministic version of the model. If you want to practice doing steady states, you can go ahead and solve the SEIR ODE model for the steady states of the variables. See e.g. the _Patterns of ID_ app for an explanation on how to do it.  If you don't want to practice, I'll tell you that the steady state value for S is S=(g~E~ * g~I~)/(b~E~ * g~I~ + b~I~ * g~E~). Use the current values to compute S and compare with results from the simulation."

## Further Information {#shinytab4}
* This app (and all others) are structured such that the Shiny part (the graphical interface you see and the server-side function that goes with it) calls an underlying R script (or several) which runs the simulation for the model of interest and returns the results.
* For this app, the underlying function(s) running the simulation are called ``r appsettings$simfunction``. You can call them directly, without going through the shiny app. Use the `help()` command for more information on how to use the functions directly. If you go that route, you need to use the results returned from this function and produce useful output (such as a plot) yourself. 
* You can also download all simulator functions and modify them for your own purposes.  Of course to modify these functions, you'll need to do some coding.
* For examples on using the simulators directly and how to modify them, read the package vignette by typing `vignette('DSAIDE')` into the R console.
* For some further reading concerning stochastic dynamics of ID, see e.g. [@lloyd-smith05a; @black66; @keeling97].
