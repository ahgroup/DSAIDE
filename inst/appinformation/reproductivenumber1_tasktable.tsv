"DSAIDE_reproductivenumber1"	"reproductivenumber1"	"Reproductive Number 1"	5	"Another way to estimate R~0~ is to determine the rate of increase in infected hosts at the beginning of the outbreak. During the initial phase, new infections increase exponentially according to _I(t)=I~0~ exp(rt)_, with _r_ being the rate of growth. Usually, for any real outbreak, you do not know the number of infected at the start, I~0~, or the exact time the outbreak starts. It is still possible to estimate _r_ by obtaining two values of _I_ at two time points during that initial growth rate, i.e. _I~1~_ at time _t~1~_ and _I~2~_ at time _t~2~_. One obtains equations _I~1~=I~0~ exp(r t~1~)_ and _I~2~=I~0~ exp(r t~2~)_. By solving one of these equations for _I~0~_ and substituting into the other, we get _I~2~= I~1~ exp(r (t~2~ - t~1~))_. By solving the model for _r_ and entering numbers for _I~1~_ and _I~2~_ and times _t~1~_ and _t~2~_ we can figure out _r_. Let's try that out. Set the model parameters back to those given in task #1. Let's try using the new method for estimating R~0~. Run the model with tfinal = 1 and tfinal = 2 and record the number of infected at the end of the simulation each time. Then substitute all the values into the equation you found for _r_ and thus compute the growth rate. For this model, the growth rate and R~0~ are related through _R~0~ = 1+rD_, where _D_ is the average duration of the infectious period (i.e. the inverse of the recovery rate). Use this to determine R~0~. You should get essentially the same answer (up to some rounding differences) as for task #1. Note that the choice of _t~1~_ and _t~2~_ can influence the results. Earlier times are better since once the number of susceptibles starts to drop markedly, the growth of infected slows down and is not exponential anymore."

(It's only called R~0~ at the beginning for a fully susceptible population). Explain how you can find that value for R, both using intuitive reasoning and using the equation for R~0~ given above (R~0~ = 1+rD). For some hints, note that at the peak numbers of infected are briefly flat, i.e. there is no more growth (what does that mean for _r_?). Also, there is no decline yet, for the infected to stay exactly the same, the average number of infections produced by one infected person before they recover needs to have a very specific value.
