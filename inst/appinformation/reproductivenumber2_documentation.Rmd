## Overview {#shinytab1}
This app covers more aspects of the reproductive number concept. Read about the model in the "Model" tab. Then do the tasks described in the "What to do" tab. If you are not familiar with the reproductive number, you should go through the 'Reproductive Number 1' app first.

This app also assumes that you have worked through the apps in the _The Basics_ section.

### Learning Objectives
* Know how to estimate the reproductive number from steady state levels of disease.
* Understand how the reproductive number can be used to parameterize models.
 

## The Model {#shinytab2}

### Model Overview
For this app, we'll use a basic compartmental SIR model that also includes births, deaths and waning immunity. We allow for 3 different stages/compartments: 

* **S** - uninfected and susceptible individuals 
* **I** - infected and infectious individuals (note that these terms are often used interchangeably, but technically we are talking about someone who is infected **and** is infectious, i.e. can infect others)
* **R** - recovered/removed individuals. Those are individuals that do not further participate, either because they are now immune or because they died.


In addition to specifying the *compartments* of a model, we need to specify the dynamics determining the changes for each compartment. Broadly speaking, some processes increase the number of individuals in a given compartment/stage and other processes that lead to a reduction. Those processes are sometimes called inflows and outflows. 

For our system, we specify the following processes/flows: 

* Susceptible individuals (S) can become infected by infectious individuals (I) at some rate, _b_. This leads to the susceptible individual leaving the S compartment and entering the I compartment.   
* Infected individuals recover and enter the recovered (R) compartment at some rate, _g_.
* Recovered individuals can lose immunity at rate _w_ and return to the susceptible compartment. 
* Natural births (into the S compartment at rate _n_) and deaths (from all compartments at rate _m_) are possible.



### Model Implementation
The flow diagram and the set of equations which are used to implement this model are as follows:


```{r modeldiagram,  fig.cap='Flow diagram for this model. ',  echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('inst/media',appsettings$modelfigname))
```


$$\dot S =n - b SI - mS + wR$$ 
$$\dot I = b S I - g I - mI$$
$$\dot R = g I - mR - wR$$


### Reproductive number

_The app and tasks deal with the reproductive number concept. I recommend reading a bit more about it. I'm following the terminology of [my own write-up](https://andreashandel.github.io/IDEMAbook/R0.html). You can also check the books listed in the ID introduction app or some of the papers listed in the _Further Resources_ section of this app._

In the _Reproductive Number 1_ app, we looked at how one can write down and equation for the reproductive number for the model used there. The model we use here is similar but not quite the same. We can use the basic definition to easily figure out the reproductive number. Recall that it is defined as the average number of new infected (and infectious) individuals caused by one infectious individual. 

For the model shown above, one can figure the value out by determining how many new infections are caused by one infected person. A person is infectious for a duration of _1/(g+m)_, the inverse of all the outflows out of the compartment. During that time they infect others at rate _b_. Thus the average number of new infections during created in _b/(g+m)_. For the whole population, assuming initially everyone is susceptible, we multiply by the number of initial susceptibles to get
$$R_0=\frac{bS_0}{g+m}$$


## What to do {#shinytab3}


**The tasks below are described in a way that assumes everything is in units of MONTHS (rate parameters, therefore, have units of inverse months). If any quantity is not given in those units, you need to convert it first (e.g. if it says a year, you need to convert it to 12 months).**


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
#this is the running counter for the records which starts at 1 
rc=1

#empty object, will hold all outcomes
alloutcomes = NULL


# Task 1
tid = 1
tasktext = "In _Reproductive Number 1_, the focus was on a single outbreak. But the reproductive number concept is also useful in situations where a disease is endemic. As you learned in the _Patterns of ID_ app (if not, go do it before this one), to achieve an endemic state, we need replenishment of susceptibles through for instance births or waning immunity. We'll start with natural births and deaths. If births (and deaths) are present, you will be able to get multiple outbreaks and endemic states. Set the parameter values such that your hosts have approximately an average lifespan of 41 years (remember to convert to months before taking the inverse). Round to the first significant digit (i.e. 0.00X). Set birth rate such that the population is steady at 1000 in the absence of any infected hosts (if you need a reminder how that's done, revisit the _ID Patterns_ app). 

Now we'll introduce the disease. Set simulation time to around 500 years, 1 infected, _g_=5, _b_=0.015. Run the simulation, make sure you reach a steady state. Compare the steady state values for S (and optional I and R) from the simulation with those predicted from the SIR steady state equations (see _Patterns of ID_ app)."

B) Now double the initial number of susceptible. What is _R~0~_ now? What do you therefore expect for the number of susceptibles at steady state? Run the simulation to see what you get. If the numbers confuse you at first glance, think carefully about the relation between _R~0~_ and both number and fraction susceptible left at steady state.

Then run a simulation with that value for _b_ (for 12 months).

Note that TB is somewhat special: An infected and infectious person (someone with TB disease) might infect many others, but only some of those will go on to develop disease and become infectious. For R~0~, we always need to go from infectious individual to another infectious individual. Also find an estimate for the duration of the infectious period for TB. Then use these quantities to determine parameters _b_ and _g_ and run a simulation with 1000 susceptible and the same birth and death rates as in task 1 (m=0.002 and n=2). Check that the steady state levels of infected/infectious individuals matches with the R~0~ value you chose.

Note: The SIR model is not a good model for TB since for TB, the stage where individuals are infected but not yet infectious is long and important. So to really model TB, one would need to include such details. We are only using TB here for illustrative purposes."

## Further Information {#shinytab4}
* This app (and all others) are structured such that the Shiny part (the graphical interface you see and the server-side function that goes with it) calls an underlying R script (or several) which runs the simulation for the model of interest and returns the results.
* For this app, the underlying function(s) running the simulation are called ``r appsettings$simfunction``. You can call them directly, without going through the shiny app. Use the `help()` command for more information on how to use the functions directly. If you go that route, you need to use the results returned from this function and produce useful output (such as a plot) yourself. 
* You can also download all simulator functions and modify them for your own purposes.  Of course to modify these functions, you'll need to do some coding.
* For examples on using the simulators directly and how to modify them, read the package vignette by typing `vignette('DSAIDE')` into the R console.
* For the equations mentioned in the tasks, see e.g. [@heffernan05a; @keeling08; @vynnycky10].
* For some information on the reproductive number, see e.g. [@fine11; @heffernan05a; @roberts07; @wallinga07].
