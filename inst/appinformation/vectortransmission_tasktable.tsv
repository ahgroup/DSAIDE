"dsaide_vectortransmission"	"Vector Transmission"	"vectortransmission"	1	"A) Set the model parameters so that there are 1000 initially susceptible for both hosts and vectors, 1 initially infected host, no infected vector, simulation duration approximately 10 years. Set the transmission rates, _b~2~_=0.003, and _b~1~_ = 0. Assume that the duration of the infectious period in hosts is half a month (about 2 weeks) long. Assume that vectors live for half a month (about 2 weeks). Set the birth rate such that in the absence of the ID, you get a steady population of 1000 vectors. You should have learned the relation between births, deaths and steady state susceptibles in the _Patterns of ID_ app. If you don't remember, you can figure it out by trying different values for the birth rate (with no infected hosts or vectors present). Turn off waning immunity for now. Run the simulation, observe what you get. You should not see any outbreak happening. Make sure you know why."	"T1R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""	""	0	0
"dsaide_vectortransmission"	"Vector Transmission"	"vectortransmission"	2	"A) Now set _b~1~_ and _b~2~_ = 0.003, and rerun the simulation. You should see an outbreak with around 183 susceptible hosts left."	"T2R1"	"Max number of infected hosts"	"Numeric"	"Report the rounded integer"	""	0	0
"dsaide_vectortransmission"	"Vector Transmission"	"vectortransmission"	3	"A) Play around with _b~1~_ and _b~2~_ and see how different values affect the ID dynamics."	"T3R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""	""	0	0
"dsaide_vectortransmission"	"Vector Transmission"	"vectortransmission"	4	"A) Now set everything back as in task #2 and start with no infected hosts and 1 infected vector. What do you expect to see? Run the simulation to check your expectation.
B) Play around with a different initial number of infected hosts and vectors and different transmission rates. Anything surprising happening? Do you understand why you see what you see?"	"T4R1"	"Max number of infected hosts (Part A)"	"Numeric"	"Report the rounded integer"	""	0	0
"dsaide_vectortransmission"	"Vector Transmission"	"vectortransmission"	5	"A) Turn off any infection process by setting the number of initial infected hosts and vectors to 0. Adjust the birth rate such that the vector population settles at 5000. Set the maximum simulation time to 12 months. Note the time it takes for the vector population to go from the initial 1000 to 5000. This rapid increase can be a problem for vector control measures."

"dsaide_vectortransmission"	"Vector Transmission"	"vectortransmission"	6	"A) Turn infection process back on by having 1 infected host. Set simulation time back to 10 years. Everything else as above. Run the simulation, contemplate the dynamics you see. You have births and deaths now, and usually with those, you can get multiple outbreaks and an endemic state. Why not here?"

"dsaide_vectortransmission"	"Vector Transmission"	"vectortransmission"	7	"A) Assume host immunity wanes after an average of 2 months. What do you expect to see? Run simulations to check your expectations. You should get a steady endemic state with a constant, non-zero number of infected hosts and vectors. The number of infected vectors at steady, endemic state should be around 1052."	"T7R1"	"Final number of suscepitble hosts at steady state"	"Numeric"	"Report the rounded integer"	""	0	0
