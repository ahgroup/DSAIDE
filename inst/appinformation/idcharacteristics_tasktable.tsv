Assume that only symptomatic individuals transmit, at rate _b~I~_ = 0.001. Assume that the duration of the presymptomatic, asymptomatic and symptomatic periods are all 5 days long. (Hint: The parameters _g~P~_, _g~A~_, and _g~I~_ are the inverses of these periods.) Assume that there are no asymptomatic infections, _f_=0, and nobody dies due to disease _d_=0. If you did it correctly, your outbreak should end with around 7 susceptibles remaining.
B) Check the results with the assumptions for the model and make sure they agree. For instance you shouldn't get any deaths, and no asymptomatic infected. From the graph, contemplate how you would estimate the day at which the outbreak peaks. What's the problem? How would you solve it? Rerun the simulation, with the same values you just had.

B) Further explore how changes in the infectiousness of the different groups (_b~P~_, _b~A~_, _b~I~_) and the average time a person spends in each of those states (_g~P~_, _g~A~_, _g~I~_) affects the infection dynamics.
