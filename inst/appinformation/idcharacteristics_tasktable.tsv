Assume that only symptomatic individuals transmit, at rate _b~I~_ = 0.001. Assume that the duration of the presymptomatic, asymptomatic and symptomatic periods are all 5 days long. (Hint: The parameters _g~P~_, _g~A~_, and _g~I~_ are the inverses of these periods.) Assume that there are no asymptomatic infections, _f_=0, and nobody dies due to disease _d_=0. Make sure the results agree with model settings. For instance you shouldn't get any deaths, and no asymptomatic infected. If you did it correctly, your outbreak should end with around 7 susceptibles remaining. From the graph, contemplate how you would estimate the day at which the outbreak peaks. What's the problem? How would you solve it? Rerun the simulation, with the same values you just had. Does anything change? Why (not)?"
