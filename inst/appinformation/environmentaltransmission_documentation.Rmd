## Overview {#shinytab1}
This app allows you to explore a model which allows for both direct transmission and transmission through an environmental stage. Read about the model in the "Model" tab. Then do the tasks described in the "What to do" tab.


## The Model {#shinytab2}

### Model Overview

This is a simple SIR model with an additional environmental compartment.

This model has the following compartments:  

* **S** - uninfected and susceptible individuals 
* **I** - individuals who are infected and infectious.
* **R** - recovered/removed individuals.
* **P** - pathogen in the environment.


The processes being modeled are:

* Susceptible individuals can become infected by either direct contact with infected hosts at rate _b~I~_ or through contact with a pathogen in the environment at rate _b~P~_.
* Infected hosts recover after some time (specified by the rate _g_). 
* New susceptibles enter (are born) at a rate _n_. From each compartment, hosts "leave" after some time (i.e. they die) at rate _m_. The inverse of this rate is the average lifespan of a host. 
* Infected hosts shed pathogen into the environment at rate _q_.
* Pathogen in the environment decays at rate _c_.


### Model Implementation
The flow diagram for this model is shown in this figure:

```{r modeldiagram,  fig.cap='',  echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here('inst/media',appsettings$modelfigname))
```

The set of ordinary differential equations (ODE) for this model are:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot S & = n - b_{I}IS -b_PPS - mS\\
\dot I & = b_{I}IS + b_PPS -gI - mI\\
\dot R & = gI - mR \\
\dot P & = qI - c P 
\end{aligned}
$$


### A comment on terminology  
It's tempting to use the letter _E_ for the environmental stage. However, the letter _E_ is generally used for the _exposed_ stage (what I generally call pre-symptomatic), which is thencalled a SEIR model. Thus, I'm using the letter _P_ here. You might see models that use _E_ for exposed or environmental stages. In general, there are no naming rules for either model compartments or parameters, so you will see all kinds of letters used. They should all be explicitly specified by the authors such that there is no ambiguity.


## What to do {#shinytab3}

**The tasks below are described in a way that assumes that everything is in units of MONTHS (rate parameters, therefore, have units of inverse months). If any quantity is not given in those units, you need to convert it first.**

tasktext = "Set the model parameters to the following values. 1000 initially susceptible individuals, 1 initially infected host, no pathogen in the environment, simulation duration 1 year. We'll first look at direct transmission. Set transmission rate of _b~I~ = 0.004_, environmental transmission _b~P~ = 0_. Set environmental pathogen shedding and clearance rates to 0. Assume that the duration of the infectious period is 15 days long (and a month has 30 days). Turn off births and deaths for now. Run the simulation. You should get the usual direct transmission dynamics and a single outbreak. You should be left with around 203 susceptibles at the end of the simulation. Remember that in a model like this, where the only flow from the susceptible class is outflow through becoming infected, everyone who is not in the susceptible compartment at the end has been infected. Thus the total number of infected during the outbreak is the different between susceptibles at the beginning and at the end. Use one of the equations you have learned about in the reproductive number apps to compute _R~0~_."

tasktext = "In the previous task, removal of pathogens in the environment happened at a rate that was so fast that it essentially tracked whatever was going on in the infected population. In such a case, one can make with is called a quasi-steady state approximation for the fast variable and assume that it's change only depends on the change of the variable it tracks. There is some formal way of doing it, a quick and often (but not always) correct way is to set the right side of the equation of the fast variable to 0. Here, that is the environmental variable, so the equation becomes _0=qI-cP_ and from that P=qI/c. Since we had _q_=_c_ in the previous task, I and P tracked each other (approximately). That is generally not the case. Explore a more general scenario by setting _q = 100_ and _c = 50_. Have direct transmission off and environmental transmission as in the previous task. Since decay is now slower, pathogen in the environment builds up to higher levels and produces an overall larger outbreak. Look at the maximum values for P and I. Compute the ratio and compare that with the equation. Keep exploring how things change for different values of _q_ and _c_."

# Task 5
##################

tasktext = "It is possible to compute the reproductive number for enviromental transmission. Recall that it is defined as the average number of infectious hosts (of 1 type) that are infected by one infectious host of the same type. Here, we need to go through the environment. First, we need to compute _how many units of environmental pathogen_ an individual host produces before they recover, and then how many hosts are infected per unit of environmental pathogen. This can be done as follows: One infected host sheds pathogen for a duration of _1/g_ at a rate _q_, so the total environmental pathogen produced by that host is _q/g_. This amount of pathogen is around for an average time of _1/c_, during which time it infects new hosts at rate _b~P~_ for a total production of new infected hosts _b~P~_/_c_. To get the number of new infectious hosts produced by one infectious host, one needs to multiply these two quantities. Then, to get the basic reproductive number, one also needs to multiply by the inital number of susceptible to get $R_0=qb_PS/(gc)$. Use the values from the last task (q=100, c=50) to compute _R~0~_ for this simulation. Then use the final-size equation to compute the fraction of susceptible you expect to get for this _R~0~_ value and confirm with the simulation."

## Further Information {#shinytab4}

* This app (and all others) are structured such that the Shiny part (the graphical interface you see and the server-side function that goes with it) calls an underlying R script (or several) which runs the simulation for the model of interest and returns the results.
* For this app, the underlying function(s) running the simulation are called ``r appsettings$simfunction``. You can call them directly, without going through the shiny app. Use the `help()` command for more information on how to use the functions directly. If you go that route, you need to use the results returned from this function and produce useful output (such as a plot) yourself. 
* You can also download all simulator functions and modify them for your own purposes.  Of course to modify these functions, you'll need to do some coding.
* For examples on using the simulators directly and how to modify them, read the package vignette by typing `vignette('DSAIDE')` into the R console.
* Some more information on environmentally transmitted ID and modeling can be found in [@codeco01].
