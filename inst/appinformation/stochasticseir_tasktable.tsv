Assume that only symptomatic individuals transmit, at rate 0.005. Assume that the duration of the presymptomatic period is one week (1/4 of a month) long, and the duration of the symptomatic period is 2 weeks (half a month) long. Assume immunity does not wane and that there are no births and deaths. Set the number of simulations to 10. Simulation start time 0, duration 1 year, time step does not matter. Set random seed to 123. With parameters set to correspond to the scenario just described, run the simulation. You should find 5 simulations that produced an outbreak and the average final value for the recovered is around 448."

"DSAIDE_stochasticseir"	"stochasticseir"	"Stochastic SEIR Model"	2	"Now set waning immunity rate to 0.2, simulation time 5 years. Keep everything as before. Run the simulation, you should find that the system settles to some kind of stochastic version of a steady state, namely S-E-I-R values that fluctuate around some level. Note that there is still a mix of simulations that did and didn't produce an outbreak. In fact, that number of simulations that produce an outbreak dropped from 5 to 4. Just by chance the inclusion of waning immunity meant that processes in the model got executed differently at the start of the simulation and a simulation that took off earlier now didn't. Let's - just for fun - look into that more closely and see if we can identify the simulation. To that end, set the number of simulations to run to 1, start with random seed 123, no waning immunity. Run the simulation. You'll see that this produces no outbreak. We want to find the one that produces an outbreak in the absence of waning immunity and does not with waning immunity turned on. So let's move to the next one, run the simulation for random seed 124 (remember from the previous app that if you run 10 simulations, internally the seed is increased each time). Again no outbreak, so let's do 125. You'll see an outbreak. Now turn on waning immunity see if you still get an outbreak (you will). Keep trying the random seeds (up to 132) until you find the seed for which you get an outbreak without waning immunity but none with waning immunity. Note that this has nothing directly to do with the waning immunity process, it just happens to mix up the random numbers in the simulation that now we don't get an outbreak."

"DSAIDE_stochasticseir"	"stochasticseir"	"Stochastic SEIR Model"	3	"Let's go back to the settings at the beginning of the previous task, namely w=0.2, 10 simulations, random seed 123. You can see that the reported final value for the susceptibles does not agree with what you see for those simulations which have a steady-state like scenario with non-zero infected. That's because the average includes also those scenarios where no outbreak happened. Essentially, the average is computed here by doing 6/10\*1000 (simulations without an outbreak) + 4/10\*Sfinal_outbreak (simulations with outbreak), where Sfinal_outbreak is the average value of susceptibles at the end of the simulation for those scenarios where you get an outbreak. Approximately read off a value for Sfinal_outbreak and convince yourself that adding the non-outbreak and outbreak scenarios together gives you the reported mean."

"DSAIDE_stochasticseir"	"stochasticseir"	"Stochastic SEIR Model"	4	"Sometimes you do want to know the overall average, including both settings where an outbreak happened and where it didn't. However, often combining those two very different scenarios can be confusing. So let's change our setup to make sure we get outbreaks every time. You learned previously that if there are more initial infected, chances of an outbreak are larger. Let's do that. Keep all settings as before, but change initial number of symptomatic infected to 2. You'll see that there are a few more outbreaks than with 1 infected, but still not all. Keep increasing the starting value for _I_ until all 10 simulations lead to outbreaks."

Run the simulation for 5 years. You should find an average of around 133 infected at the end. While there is no guarantee that the average of the stochastic model agrees with an equivalent deterministic model for the types of (nonlinear) models we are exploring, they are often close. We can check that by computing the steady states for the deterministic version of the model. If you want to practice doing steady states, you can go ahead and solve the SEIR ODE model for the steady states of the variables. See e.g. the _Patterns of ID_ app for an explanation on how to do it.  If you don't want to practice, I'll tell you that the steady state value for S is S=(g~E~ * g~I~)/(b~E~ * g~I~ + b~I~ * g~E~).
