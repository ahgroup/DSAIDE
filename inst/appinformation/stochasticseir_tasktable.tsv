"dsaide_stochasticseir"	"Stochastic SEIR Model"	"stochasticseir"	1	"A) Set the following model parameters to start 1000 susceptible and 1 initially symptomatic host. Simulation duration approximately 5 years. Assume that only symptomatic individuals transmit, at rate 0.002. Assume that the duration of the symptomatic period is 1 month long, the duration of the presymptomatic period is half a month long. Assume immunity does not wane and that there are no births and deaths. Set the number of simulations to 1. With parameters set to correspond to the scenario just described, run the simulation.
B) If you rerun the simulation without changing anything, what do you expect to see? Test your expectations by running the simulation several times. To speed things up, set the number of simulations to 20, to run all 20."	"T1R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""	""	0	0
"dsaide_stochasticseir"	"Stochastic SEIR Model"	"stochasticseir"	2	"* In the previous task, you should have seen that occasionally, no outbreak occurs (because the infected person recovers/dies before they can infect others). Explore how the initial number of infected influences the chance of (not) getting outbreaks. Set the initial number of infected to 5, everything as above. Run 20 outbreaks at a time, repeat a few times. Observe the number of times you do (not) get an outbreak. Repeat with the initial number of infected at 2,3, and 10."

Set the duration of the symptomatic period to 1 month and the duration of the presymptomatic period to half a month. Simulation time about 5 years. No births and deaths. Set the number of simulations to 1. Run the model several times. You should see the stochastic version of a steady state, namely S-E-I-R values that fluctuate around some level."

Now change the number of simulations to 5, 10, 20 (be patient). See how the average number of susceptibles at the end of the simulation settles down to some number. It will still fluctuate a bit, but as you take the average of more simulations, results become more stable (deterministic). "	"T5R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""	""	0	0
