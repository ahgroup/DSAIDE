Transmission rate of 0.0005, duration of infectious period 5 days, no births and deaths, random seed of 100. Run the deterministic simulation multiple times. You should always see the same result.
B) Now run a single stochastic simulation multiple times. What do you expect? What do you see? Change the random seed to 101, then 102. Test how this changes the simulation."	"T1R1"	"Total number of recovered at end of outbreak with random seed = 101"	"Numeric"	"Report the rounded integer"	""	0	0

"dsaide_13_stochasticsir"	"Stochastic SIR Model"	13	2	"A) Keep everything as in task 1, with random number seed at 100. Run both simulations and set the number of stochastic simulations to 5. You'll get a plot showing the deterministic model dynamics and 5 runs for the stochastic model (each of the stochastic runs gets consecutive random number seeds, i.e. the first one is 100, the 2nd is 101,...).

"dsaide_13_stochasticsir"	"Stochastic SIR Model"	13	4	"A) You can mathematically derive an equation linking the probability that an outbreak occurs, _p_, to the reproductive number (see e.g. [@keeling08]). We won't try to do the math here but instead see if we can use the simulation to figure it out. Start with the settings in task 1. Run the stochastic model for b = 0.0002, 0.0003, 0.0004, 0.0005, 0.0006, 0.001, 0.002. For each value, compute R~0~, run the model 100 times, with max time 300 and record the number of times you get an outbreak. Plot the relationship (either by hand or using the computer) between the probability of getting an outbreak and _R~0~_."

"dsaide_13_stochasticsir"	"Stochastic SIR Model"	13	5	"A) There is a similar relation between outbreak probability an the initial number of infected individuals. Let's see if we can use the model to determine it. Follow the steps of the previous task. Keep _b_ fixed at 0.0003, vary the initial number of infected individuals, _I~0~_, from 1 to 10. Record the fraction of outbreaks you got for each _I~0~_. Plot the relationship (either by hand or using the computer) between the probability of getting an outbreak and _I~0~_."
