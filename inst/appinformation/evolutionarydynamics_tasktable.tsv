"dsaide_evolutionarydynamics"	"Evolution of Drug Resistance"	"evolutionarydynamics"	1	"A) Set the model parameters to the following: susceptible _S~0~_ = 500, and initially untreated infected host _I~u0~_ = 1. No other infected hosts _I~t0~_ = 0 and _I~r0~_ = 0. Set simulation duration, _tmax_, to approximately half a year. Assume that untreated individuals transmit at _b~u~_ = 0.001, treated at _b~t~_ = 0.0005, and resistant at _b~r~_ = 0.0008. Assume that the duration of the infectious period is 5 days for untreated, 4 days for treated and 5 days for resistant (for those individuals, treatment has no effect). Set the rates _g~i~_ accordingly. Set the number of simulations to 20. Assume nobody receives treatment and no resistance is generated (_f = c~u~ = c~t~ = 0_). With parameters set to correspond to the scenario just described, run the simulation. You should see some simulations with outbreaks and some without. For those _with outbreaks_, you should have around 10-100 susceptible left at the end."	"T1R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""	""	0	0

"dsaide_evolutionarydynamics"	"Evolution of Drug Resistance"	"evolutionarydynamics"	6	"A) Keep exploring. For instance, try the following: Turn on resistance generation for both treated, _c~t~_, and untreated, _c~u~_. Explore how population size, _S~0~_, the fraction of resistance generation ( _c~t~_ or _c~u~_ ) and fitness of the different strains ( _b~t~_ or _b~u~_ or _b~r~_ ) affect outcomes. If you want to explore the relation between treatment level and outbreak size (tasks 3-5) in more detail, you could access the underlying simulation directly and write a bit of R code to loop over treatment values following the _Level 2_ example described in the DSAIDE tutorial."
