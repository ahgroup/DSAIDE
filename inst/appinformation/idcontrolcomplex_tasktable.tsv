1	"Set the model parameters such that it corresponds to the following setting: 1000 susceptible hosts and vectors, 1 initially symptomatic host, no infected vectors or pathogen in the environment. Simulation duration approximately 5 years. Assume that only symptomatic individuals transmit, at a rate of 0.002. All other transmission rates should be 0. Assume that the duration of the symptomatic period is 1 month long, the duration of the presymptomatic period is half a month long. Assume that there are no asymptomatic infections. You can, therefore, set the rate of recovery of asymptomatics to anything, it doesn't matter because nobody will be asymptomatic. Assume that no environmental shedding and decay occurs. Assume nobody dies due to disease, and immunity does not wane. Assume that there are no births or natural deaths occurring. With parameters set to correspond to the scenario just described, run the simulation and ensure you get a single outbreak with ~20% susceptibles left at the end."

2	"Let's now assume that 50% of infected hosts are asymptomatic (_f_) and that the duration of the asymptomatic stage (_gA_) is the same as the symptomatic stage (_gI_). Also, assume that asymptomatic infected are half as infectious as symptomatic infected, and that pre-symptomatic are as infectious as symptomatic. Run the simulation, you should get an outbreak with around ~11% susceptibles left.

B) Now, we will envision a scenario where we can only detect and quarantine individuals that show symptoms. Assume that quarantining reduces infectiousness by half. Implement such a scenario, run the simulation.
C) Now, we will envision a scenario where we can quarantine everyone who has become infected, independent of symptom status. Implement such a scenario, again run the simulation and record the number of susceptibles left at the end."	"T2R1"	"Peak/Maximum number of infected."
