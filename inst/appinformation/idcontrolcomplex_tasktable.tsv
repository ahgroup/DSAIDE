1	"Set the model parameters such that it corresponds to the following setting: 1000 susceptible hosts and vectors, 1 initially symptomatic host, all other compartments start at 0. Assume that there are no births or natural deaths occurring for either hosts or vectors. Assume that only symptomatic individuals transmit, at a rate of 0.002. All other transmission rates should be 0. Assume that the duration of the symptomatic period is 1 month long, the duration of the presymptomatic period is half a month long. Assume that there are no asymptomatic infections. You can, therefore, set the rate of recovery of asymptomatics to anything, it doesn't matter because nobody will be asymptomatic. Assume that no environmental shedding and decay occurs. Assume nobody dies due to disease, and immunity does not wane.  Simulation duration approximately 5 years. With parameters set to correspond to the scenario just described, run the simulation and ensure you get a single outbreak with ~20% susceptibles left at the end."

2	"Let's now assume that 50% of infected hosts will be asymptomatic (_f_) and that the duration of the asymptomatic stage (_gA_) is the same as the symptomatic stage (_gI_). Also, assume that asymptomatic infected are half as infectious as symptomatic infected, and that pre-symptomatic are as infectious as symptomatic. Run the simulation, you should get an outbreak with around 107 susceptibles left. Now, we will envision a scenario where we can only detect and quarantine individuals that show symptoms. Assume that quarantining reduces infectiousness by half. Implement such a scenario, run the simulation. 

If you are up for a small, optional, challenge, compute R~0~ for this scenario. It will be the sum of transmission coming from all 3 infected compartments (P, A, I), other than that it follows the standard procedure you learned about and you can compare what you get from doing the math with the final size equation. You can then use your R~0~ equation for the next following tasks."	"T2R1"	"Number susceptibles remaining at end of quarantine simulation."

4	"Set parameter values back to what they were at the start of the previous task. Now assume that we can administer a drug. It will likely only be given to symptomatic individuals. First assume that the drug reduces the infectiousness of symptomatic individuals by half. Run the simulation. Convince yourself that this has the same effect as assuming quarantine of symptomatic individuals above. Now assume that the drug also reduces the duration of the symptomatic period from a month to half a month. What do you expect this shortening of the symptomatic period will do?

5	"Set parameter values back to what they were at the start of the previous task. Then change transmission terms such that bP=0.001, bA=0.002, bI=0.001. Can you think of a pathogen where asymptomatic individuals might be more infectious than symptomatic individuals? Some STI might fall into this category. Pathogens that require close contact could also be of that type if symptomatic are at home sick and can't spread the disease. Run the simulation with those settings, you should see an outbreak with around 203 susceptible left. Now assume that we can administer a drug which reduces symptoms in people, but doesn't change their infectiousness. We mimic this by assuming the fraction that are asymptomatic increases to 75%. What do you expect this will do to the overall outbreak size? Run the simulation to check."	"T5R1"	"Number susceptibles remaining at end of simulation."

6	"Now let's consider a pathogen that has some environmental transmission component. Set everything as in task 1. Then turn on environmental shedding by symptomatic individuals by setting pI=2 and set decay of pathogen in environment to c=1. Run the simulation. You should see E come up and go back down similar to the I curve. Make a note of the maximum value for E, it should be around 194. Since we haven't turned on transmission from the environment yet, the outbreak size should be the same as in task 1. Now set bE=0.0005. You will see a larger outbreak (less susceptible hosts remaining) and also higher levels of E. Why do you see a larger outbreak and more E now? Think about how the pathogen moves through the system.

Again, if you are up for an optional challenge and work on your R~0~ skills, determine R~0~ for this scenario. You can use the discussion in the _Environmental Transmission_ app to guide you. Since here we have transmission both through environment and direct transmission, R~0~ will be the sum of transmission coming from all 3 infected compartments (P, A, I) and the environement E. Though for this task, we have no transmission from P and A, so the sum is only the transmission terms from I and E."	"T6R1"	"Number susceptibles remaining at end of simulation."
