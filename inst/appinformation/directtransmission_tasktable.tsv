1	"A) Run the simulation with 999 susceptible individuals and 1 initially infected host. Set the simulation duration, to 10 years. Consider density-dependent transmission, with a transmission rate of _b~d~_ = 0.005, and an area of size 2. Assume that the duration of the infectious period is 15 days long (and that there are 30 days in a month). Turn off births, deaths and waning immunity for now. If you did it correctly, your outbreak should end with around 626 susceptible individuals still remaining. Take a look at the force of infection (FOI) equation for density-dependent transmission. The FOI value changes throughout the outbreak because it has _I_ in the equation. But the other parts of the equation remain constant. Compute the FOI value for the settings here at the start of the outbreak (I=1)."

2	"Now switch the scenario to frequency-dependent from density-dependent transmission. Set _b~f~_ = 2.5. The value of _b~d~_ does not matter since only one type of transmission is turned on at any time. Leave all other settings as before. Before you run the simulation, compute the force of infection for frequency-dependent transmission for the chosen parameter values. Compare to the value from the previous task. Based on that, what do you expect to get for the outbreak? Run the simulation to confirm your expectation."

3	"Let's assume we are now in a location with twice the number of people as before (_S~0~_ = 1999), living in the same area. All other quantities (rate of transmission, recovery time, etc.) are assumed to be the same. Take a look at the FOI equations for density-dependent transmission. Based on its value for this new scenario, how do you expect the outbreak to change if transmission is density-dependent? Note that you will need to consider how _I_ is impacted by a changing population size and how it factors into the FOI during the outbreak to fully understand what's going on.

6	"Keep exploring by trying different parameters and transmission settings and see how they influence results. You can also go beyond a single outbreak and turn on births/deaths (which can impact population size) or waning immunity. As you continue your exploration, think about real infectious diseases that might be approximated by either one of the transmission types, and what approximate choices for the model parameters would describe those IDs."
