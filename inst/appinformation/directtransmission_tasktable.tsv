"dsaide_directtransmission"	"Direct Transmission"	"directtransmission"	1	"A) Run the simulation with 1000 susceptible individuals and 1 initially infected host. Set the simulation duration, _tmax_ to 10 years. Consider density-dependent transmission, with a transmission rate of _b~d~_ = 0.005, and an area of size 2. Assume that the duration of the infectious period is 15 days long (and that there are 30 days in a month). Turn off births, deaths and waning immunity for now. If you did it correctly, your outbreak should end with around 625 susceptible individuals still remaining."

"dsaide_directtransmission"	"Direct Transmission"	"directtransmission"	2	"A) Now switch to frequency-dependent transmission, set _b~f~_ = 2.5. Leave all other settings as before.
B) Think about your expectations, run the simulation and compare your expectations with the results.Anything surprising happening? Do you understand why you see what you see?"	"T2R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""	""	0	0
"dsaide_directtransmission"	"Direct Transmission"	"directtransmission"	3	"A) Let's assume we are now in a location with twice the number of people as before (_S~0~_ = 1999) , living in the same area. Implement that in the simulation by changing population size, keep all other settings as above.
B) What do you expect to see for the frequency and density dependent scenarios? Does anything change? Do you undstand why?"	"T3R1"	"Total number of recovered at end of outbreak (senario = 1)"	"Numeric"	"Report the rounded integer"	""	0	0

"dsaide_directtransmission"	"Direct Transmission"	"directtransmission"	4	"A) If you double the population size as you just did, how do you need to adjust the area to obtain the same sized outbreak with regard to the fraction of people getting infected/remaining susceptible for density-dependent transmission? Try with the simulation and see if your expectation is correct."	"T4R1"	"The area used to get the same fraction"	"Numeric"	"Report the rounded integer"	""	0	0
"dsaide_directtransmission"	"Direct Transmission"	"directtransmission"	5	"A) Keep exploring by trying different parameters and transmission settings and see how they influence results. You can also go beyond a single outbreak and turn on births/deaths (which can impact population size) or waning immunity.
B) As you continue your exploration, think about real infectious diseases that might be approximated by either one of the transmission types, and what approximate choices for the model parameters would describe those IDs."	"T5R1"	"Nothing"	"None"	""	""	0	0
