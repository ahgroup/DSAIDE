<h2>What to do</h2>&#13;
<p><em>Note: Some of the simulations might take a few seconds to run. While they run, you should see a ‘Simulation running’ message.</em></p>&#13;
<div id="task-1" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 1:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set the model parameters such that it corresponds to the following setting:&#13;
<ul><li>1000 susceptible hand 1 initially symptomatic host.</li>&#13;
<li>Simulation duration approximately 5 years.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that only symptomatic individuals transmit, at rate 0.002.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that the duration of the symptomatic period is 1 month long, the duration of the presymptomatic period is half a month long.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume immunity does not wane and that there are no births and deaths.</li>&#13;
<li>Set number of simulations to 1.</li>&#13;
</ul></li>&#13;
<li>With parameters set to correspond to the scenario just described, run the simulation.</li>&#13;
<li>If your run the simulation again without changing anything, what do you expect to see? Test your expectations by running the simulation several times.</li>&#13;
<li>To speed things up, set the number of simulations to 20, run all 20.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-2" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 2:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>In the previous task, you should have seen that occasionally, no outbreak occurs (because the infected person recovers/dies before they can infect others). Explore how the initial number of infected influences the chance of (not) getting outbreaks. Set initial number of infected to 5, everything as above.</li>&#13;
<li>Run 20 outbreaks at a time, repeat a few times. Observe the number of times you do (not) get an outbreak.</li>&#13;
<li>Repeat with initial number of infected at 2,3, and 10.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-3" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 3:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set everything as in task 1, with 1 initial infected. Now explore how the rate of transmission (and with it the reproductive number) affects outbreaks.</li>&#13;
<li>Try values for the transmission rate of 0.001, 0.0015 and 0.004. Compare the results.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
