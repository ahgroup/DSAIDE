<h3>Task 1:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set the model parameters such that it corresponds to the following setting:&#13;
<ul><li>1000 susceptible hosts and vectors, 1 initially symptomatic host, no infected vectors or pathogen in environment.</li>&#13;
<li>Simulation duration approximately 5 years.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that only symptomatic individuals transmit, at rate <em>b<sub>I</sub></em> = 0.002. All other transmission rates should be 0.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that the duration of the symptomatic period is 1 month long, the duration of the presymptomatic period is half a month long.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that there are no asymptomatic infections. You can therefore set the rate of recovery of asymptomatics, <span class="math inline">\(g_A\)</span> to anything, it doesn’t matter because nobody will be asymptomatic.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that no environmental shedding and decay occurs.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume nobody dies due to disease, and immunity does not wane.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that there are no births and non-disease deaths occurring.</li>&#13;
</ul></li>&#13;
<li>With parameters set to correspond to the scenario just described, run the simulation and ensure you get a single outbreak with 20% susceptibles left at the end.</li>&#13;
