<h2>What to do</h2>&#13;
<div id="task-1" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 1:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set the model parameters such that it corresponds to the following setting:&#13;
<ul><li>1000 susceptible hosts and 1 infected host of type 1.</li>&#13;
<li>200 susceptible hosts and 1 infected host of type 2.</li>&#13;
<li>Simulation duration approximately 5 years.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that transmission from host 1 to host 1 is 0.002, from host 2 to host 2 is 0.01. No transmission from one host type to the other.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that the duration of the infectious period is 1 month long for both types.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume nobody dies due to disease, and immunity does not wane.</li>&#13;
<li>No waning immunity or natural births/deaths.</li>&#13;
</ul></li>&#13;
<li>With parameters set to correspond to the scenario just described, run the simulation and ensure you get outbreaks in both populations with 20% susceptibles left at the end.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-2" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 2:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set the transmission rate from host 1 to host 1 to 0.001. Rest as before. Run the simulation.</li>&#13;
<li>Now set the transmission rate from host 2 to host 1 to 0.001. You should see an outbreak in both populations. This is an example of a core group driving the dynamics. Contemplate what the core group does.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-3" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 3:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Keep all settings as before, but set initial number of infected type 1 hosts to 0.</li>&#13;
<li>Contemplate what you expect to see, run the simulation, see if your expectations are confirmed.</li>&#13;
<li>Now set the initial number of infected type 1 hosts back to 1, and infected type 2 hosts to 0.</li>&#13;
<li>Contemplate what you expect to see, run the simulation, see if your expectations are confirmed.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-4" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 4:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set the transmission rate from host 1 to host 1 to 0. Same for the transmission rate between type 2 hosts.</li>&#13;
<li>Set the transmission rate from host 2 to host 1 to 0.01, from host 1 to host 2 to 0.002. Those are the same values used in task 1 for transmission among the same hosts.</li>&#13;
<li>Set the number of infected for type 1 and 2 both to 1.</li>&#13;
<li>Contemplate what you expect to see, run the simulation, see if your expectations are confirmed.</li>&#13;
<li>Now set the transmission rate from host 1 to host 2 to 0.01, from host 2 to host 1 to 0.002. Again, think about your expectations, run simulation and check.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-5" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 5:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Repeat the previous task, with only infected of type 1 initially present.</li>&#13;
<li>Contemplate what you expect to see, run the simulation, see if your expectations are confirmed.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-6" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 6:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Repeat the previous task, with only infected of type 2 initially present.</li>&#13;
<li>Contemplate what you expect to see, run the simulation, see if your expectations are confirmed.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-7" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 7:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set everything as in task 1, but with waning immunity for both types at a rate 0.2.</li>&#13;
<li>Run simulation, confirm that both populations reach a steady endemic state.</li>&#13;
<li>Set transmission from type 2 to type 1 to 0.005, run the simulation and see what changes.</li>&#13;
<li>Set transmission from type 1 to type 2 to 0.005, other cross-transmission back to 0. Run the simulation and see what changes.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-8" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 8:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>With the settings you just had, turn off waning immunity for type 1, run the simulation and see what you get.</li>&#13;
<li>Turn waning immunity for type 1 back on and turn off for type 2, run the simulation and see what you get.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-9" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 9:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Keep exploring. Think of a real ID where accounting for 2 types of hosts is important, see if you can use the simulation to approximate and explore that ID.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
