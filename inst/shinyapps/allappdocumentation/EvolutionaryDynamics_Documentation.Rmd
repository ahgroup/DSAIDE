##Overview {#shinytab1}
For this module, we will explore a stochastic SIR-type model with 2 different pathogen strains, wild-type and a drug resistant mutant in the presence of drug treatment. Read about the model in the "Model" tab. Then do the tasks described in the "What to do" tab.


##The Model {#shinytab2}

###Model Overview

This model tracks susceptibles, wild-type infected untreated, wild-type infected treated, drug-resistant infected and recovered hosts. 
The following compartments are included:  

* **S** - uninfected and susceptible individuals 
* **I~u~** - individuals who are infected with the wild-type/drug sensitive strain and not on treatment.
* **I~t~** - individuals who are infected with the wild-type/drug sensitive strain and on treatment.
* **I~r~** - individuals who are infected with the drug-resistant strain. Treatment has no impact on those hosts.
* **R** - recovered/removed individuals. Those individuals have recovered and are immune. 


The included processes/mechanisms are the following:

* Susceptible individuals (S) can become infected by untreated or treated hosts infected with the wild-type strain at rates _b~u~_ and _b~t~_. A fraction _f_ of those hosts are assumed to receive treatment, while the remainder do not. Small fractions (_c~u~_ and _c~t~_) of wild-type infected untreated or treated hosts can generate resistant mutants and transmit those, leading to resistant infections.  
* Susceptible individuals (S) can become infected by hosts infected with the resistant strain at rate _b~r~_. 
* All infected hosts recover at some rate _g~i~_, with _i=u,t,r_. 
* Recovered individuals are immune to reinfection. 


###Model Implementation
The flow diagram for the model implemented in this app is:

![Flow diagram for this model.](../media/evolutionmodel.png)


Note that this model is _not_ an ordinary differential equation model. It is instead its stochastic equivalent.
We can specify the model by writing down every possible transition/event/reaction that can occur and their propensities (the propensity multiplied with the
time step gives the probability that a given event/transition occurs). For our model these are the following:

Event type              |  Transitions               |   Propensity      |
----------              |  -----------               |   ----------      |
S turn into I~u~        |  S => S-1,  I~u~ => I~u~+1 |   (1-f) * (b~u~ * (1-c~u~) * I~u~ + b~t~ * (1-c~t~) * I~t~) * S  |
S turn into I~t~        |  S => S-1,  I~t~ => I~t~+1 |   f * (b~u~ * (1-c~u~) * I~u~ + b~t~ * (1-c~t~) * I~t~) * S  |
S turn into I~r~        |  S => S-1,  I~r~ => I~r~+1 |   (b~u~ * c~u~ * I~u~ + b~t~ * c~t~ * I~t~ + b~r~ * I~r~) * S  |
Recovery of I~u~        |  I~u~ => I~u~-1, R => R+1  |   g~u~ * I~u~       |
Recovery of I~t~        |  I~t~ => I~t~-1, R => R+1  |   g~t~ * I~t~       |
Recovery of I~r~        |  I~r~ => I~r~-1, R => R+1  |   g~r~ * I~r~       |




##What to do {#shinytab3}

__All parameters described below and in the model are assumed to be in units of (inverse) days__
      
###Task 1: 
* Set the model parameters such that it corresponds to the following setting: 
    * Susceptible _S~0~ = 500_, and initially untreated infected host _Iu~0~ = 1_. No other infected hosts _It~0~ = 0_ and _Ir~0~ = 0_.
    * Set simulation duration, _tmax_, to approximately half a year.
    * Assume that untreated individuals transmit at _b~U~ = 0.001_, treated at _b~T~ = 0.0005_, and resistant at _b~R~ = 0.0008_. 
    * Assume that the duration in days of the infectious period is _g~U~ = 1/5_ for untreated, _g~T~ = 1/4_ for treated, and _g~R~ = 1/5_ for resistant. 
    * Set the number of simulations to 20.
    
* With parameters set to correspond to the scenario just described, run the simulation.
* You should see some simulations with outbreaks and some without. For those with outbreaks, you should have around 10-100 susceptible left at the end.

###Task 2: 
* With everything as before, set _Iu~0~ = 10_. 
* Run simulations. You should pretty much always get outbreaks. Record the average number of susceptibles left.


###Task 3: 
* With the same settings as _Task 2_ turn on treatment ( _f != 0_ ). Run the simulation with fraction receiving treatment, _f_, at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.
* Observe what happens to the susceptibles, _S_, at the end of the outbreak as you change treatment. Draw conclusions about the usefulness of treatment.

###Task 4: 
* Now allow resistance to be generated during treatment ( _c~T~ != 0_ ). 
* Set _c~T~ = 0.2_ for the fraction of resistant generation from treatment.
* Set _f = 0_. Contemplate what you expect to see. Run simulations to check.
* Now turn on treatment. Run the simulation with _f_ at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.

###Task 5: 
* Repeat task 3 with the number of simulations set to 50. For each of the 5 treatment levels ( _f_ ) record the average number of susceptibles ( _S_ ) left at the end. 
* Set the rate of transmission to _b~R~ = 0.001_ for resistant hosts, _b~U~ = 0.001_ for untreated hosts, and turn resistance generation on _c~T~ = 0.3_.
* Repeat running 50 simulations at a time (you can repeat a few times to get a better idea of random variation). For each of the 5 treatment levels ( _f_ ) record the average number of susceptibles ( _S_ ) left at the end. 
* In your head or on a piece of paper, sketch out the relationship between treatment level ( _f_ ) and the number of susceptibles ( _S_ ) left at the end in the absence and presence of resistance evolution, _c~T~_. What do you conclude from that?

###Task 6: 
* Keep exploring. 
* Turn on resistance generation by treated, _c~T~_, and untreated, _c~U~_. 
* Explore how population size, _S~0~_, the fraction of resistance generation ( _c~T~_ or _c~U~_ ) and fitness of the different strains ( _b~T~_ or _b~U~_ or _b~R~_ ) affect outcomes.



##Further Information {#shinytab4}

* The model is a simpler version of a previously published model in [@handel09a]. 
* For this app, the underlying function running the simulation is called `simulate_evolution.R`. You can call this function directly, without going through the shiny app. Check the help file for the function for more information. 
* If you call the function directly, you need to process the results returned from this function and produce useful output (such as a plot) yourself. 
* You can also modify this R function for your own purposes. To find out how to do that, type `?DSAIDE` at the R console.
