<h2>What to do</h2>&#13;
<p><em>A general note: Some of the tasks below are fairly open ended. You shouldn’t go through the tasks like a check-list. Instead, explore these simulations, play with them, query them. As you do, loop through iterations of formulating your expectations for a specific scenario/task, running the model and observing results, and if results don’t agree with your expectations, figure out why. Essentially, <strong>“do science/research”</strong>.</em></p>&#13;
<div id="task-1" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 1:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Set the model parameters such that it corresponds to the following setting:&#13;
<ul><li>A population size of 1000 for both hosts and vectors, 1 initially infected host, no infected vector, simulation duration approximately 10 years.</li>&#13;
<li>Set host -&gt; vector transmission rate, <em>b<sub>2</sub></em>=0.001. Keep <em>b<sub>1</sub></em> = 0.</li>&#13;
<li>Set environmental pathogen shedding and clearance to 0.</li>&#13;
<li>Assume that the duration of the infectious period in hosts is half a month (about 2 weeks) long.</li>&#13;
<li>Turn off births and deaths and waning immunity for now.</li>&#13;
</ul></li>&#13;
<li>Run the simulation, observe what you get.</li>&#13;
<li>Now set <em>b<sub>1</sub></em> = <em>b<sub>2</sub></em>, run again. Then set <em>b<sub>1</sub></em> = 2 <em>b<sub>2</sub></em>, run again.</li>&#13;
<li>Record the number and fraction of susceptible/infected/recovered remaining at the end of the outbreak.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-2" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 2:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Now start with no infected hosts and 1 infected vector. What do you expect to see? Run the simulation to check your expectation.</li>&#13;
<li>Play around with different initial number of infected hosts and vectors and different transmission rates.</li>&#13;
<li>Anything surprising happening? Do you understand why you are seeing what you see?</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-3" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 3:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Turn off any infection process by setting number of initial infected hosts and vectors to 0.</li>&#13;
<li>Let’s assume our vectors are mosquitos, and that they live for about 1 month. Set the death rate accordingly.</li>&#13;
<li>Set the birth rate such that the vector population settles at 2000.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-4" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 4:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Turn infection process back on by having an infected host. Everything else as above.</li>&#13;
<li>Contemplate the dynamics you see.</li>&#13;
<li>You have births and deaths now, and usually with those you can get multiple outbreaks. Why not here?</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-5" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 5:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Assume host immunity wanes after an average of 4 months.</li>&#13;
<li>What do you expect to see? Run simulations to check your expectations.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
<div id="task-6" class="section level3">&#13;
<h3>Task 6:</h3>&#13;
<ul><li>Keep exploring.</li>&#13;
<li>Try to figure out how the different parameters influence the dynamics, specifically the (lack of) sustained cycles.</li>&#13;
</ul></div>&#13;
