<h2>The Model</h2>&#13;
<p>This simulation is based on a simple probabilistic model of infection. For any given time point, the host has fixed probabilities of infection by pathogens A or B, assuming no prior infection, respectively, and fixed probabilities of recovery from whichever pathogens it is infected with, if any. The number of time periods over which the simulation is run is determined by the user. The host can become infected with A, B, or both, but cannot become reinfected with a given pathogen after recovery, if there is one.</p>
