<h2>Overview</h2>&#13;
<p>The main menu doesn’t have tabs, therefore this text will not be displayed. The file exists such that header and footer are properly generated and placed into the app’s www folder. In the future, it would be possible to have extra text written here included as tabs below the main menu.</p>&#13;
