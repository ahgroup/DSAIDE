<ul><li>For this app, the underlying function running the simulation is called <code>simulate_idpatterns.R</code>. You can call this function directly, without going through the shiny app. Check the help file for the function for more information.</li>&#13;
<li>If you call the function directly, you need to process the results returned from this function and produce useful output (such as a plot) yourself.</li>&#13;
<li>You could also modify this R function for your own purposes - though that requires R coding knowledge.</li>&#13;
