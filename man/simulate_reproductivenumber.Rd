\title{Simulation of a compartmental infectious disease transmission model to study the reproductive number}
\usage{
simulate_reproductivenumber(S0 = 1000, I0 = 1, f = 0, e = 0,
  tmax = 300, g = 10, b = 0.01, m = 0, n = 0, w = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{S0}{initial number of susceptible hosts}

\item{I0}{initial number of infected hosts}

\item{f}{fraction of vaccinated individuals. Those individuals are moved from S to R at the beginning of the simulation}

\item{e}{efficacy of vaccine, given as fraction between 0 and 1}

\item{tmax}{maximum simulation time, units depend on choice of units for your
parameters}

\item{g}{rate at which a person leaves the I compartment}

\item{b}{level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the I compartment}

\item{m}{the rate at which new individuals enter the model (are born)}

\item{n}{the rate of natural death (the inverse it the average lifespan)}

\item{w}{rate at which recovered persons loose immunity and return to susceptible state}
}
\value{
This function returns the simulation result as obtained from a call
  to the deSolve ode solver.
}
\description{
Simulation of a basic SIR compartmental model with these compartments:
  Susceptibles (S), Infected/Infectious (I),
  Recovered and Immune (R).
  
  The model is assumed to be in units of months when run through the Shiny App.
  However as long as all parameters are chosen in the same units, 
  one can directly call the simulator assuming any time unit.
}
\details{
A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments
  is simulated as a set of ordinary differential
  equations. The function returns the output from the odesolver as a matrix,
  with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
}
\section{Warning}{

  This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do
  something nonsensical (e.g. negative values or fractions > 1),
  the code will likely abort with an error message.
}

\examples{
  # To run the simulation with default parameters just call this function
  result <- simulate_reproductivenumber()
  # To choose parameter values other than the standard one, specify them e.g. like such
  result <- simulate_reproductivenumber(S0 = 2000, I0 = 10, tmax = 100, g = 0.5, n = 0.1)
  # You should then use the simulation result returned from the function, e.g. like this:
  plot(result[,1],result[,2],xlab='Time',ylab='Number Susceptible',type='l')
}
