\value{
This function returns the simulation result as obtained from a call
  to the adaptivetau integrator in list form. The list element ts is a
  dataframe where the first column is "time," and the remaining columns are the variables
}
\description{
Simulation of a stochastic 2-strain SIR model with the following compartments:
Susceptibles (S), Infected with wild-type/sensitive and untreated (Iu),
Infected with wild-type and treated (It), infected with resistant (Ir), 
Recovered and Immune (R). allows exploration of evolutionary dynamics
}
\details{
A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments
is simulated as a stochastic model using the adaptive tau algorithm as implemented by ssa.adaptivetau()
in the adaptivetau package. See the manual of this package for more details.

\section{Warning}{

This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do
something nonsensical (e.g. have negative values or fractions > 1),
the code will likely abort with an error message
}

\examples{
# To run the simulation with default parameters just call the function:
result <- simulate_evolution_stochastic()
# To choose parameter values other than the standard one, specify them like such:
result <- simulate_evolution_stochastic(S = 2000,  tmax = 200, bt = 0.01)
# You should then use the simulation result returned from the function, like this:
plot(result$ts[ , "time"],result$ts[ , "S"],xlab='Time',ylab='Number Susceptible',type='l')
}

            The implemented model is loosely based on: Handel et al 2009 JTB 
           "Antiviral resistance and the control of pandemic influenza: The roles of
           stochasticity, evolution and model details"
