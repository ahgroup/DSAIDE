\title{A helper function that takes a model and generates shiny UI elements}
\usage{
generate_shinyinput(mbmodel, otherinputs = NULL, packagename)
}
\arguments{
\item{mbmodel}{a string containing the name of a simulator function for which to build inputs}

\item{otherinputs}{a list of other shiny inputs to include in the UI}

\item{packagename}{name of package using this function (DSAIDE or DSAIRM)}
}
\value{
A renderUI object that can be added to the shiny output object for display in a Shiny UI
}
\description{
This function generates shiny UI inputs for a supplied model.
This is a helper function called by the shiny app.
}
\details{
This function is called by the Shiny app to produce the Shiny input UI elements.
mbmodel is assumed to be the name of a function. The file correpsonding to this function is assumed to live in the
simulatorfunctions subfolder and to be an exact copy of the same file in the /R folder of the source package. 
This R file will be loaded and the documentation parsed to create UI elements. 
Therefore, all simulator_ R functions/scripts need to follow a specific syntax.
Every argument needs to be of the form
param X : param explanation : param type 
example: 
b : transmission rate : numeric
Non-numeric arguments of functions are removed and need to be included in the otherinputs argument.
