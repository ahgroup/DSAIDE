\title{Simulation of a compartmental infectious disease transmission model to study the reproductive number}
\usage{
simulate_idcontrolmultioutbreak_ode(S = 1000, I = 1, R = 0,
  b = 0.01, g = 5, f = 0.3, tstart = 10, tend = 50, tmax = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{: initial number of susceptible hosts : numeric}

\item{I}{: initial number of infected hosts : numeric}

\item{R}{: initial number of recovered hosts : numeric}

\item{b}{: level/rate of infectiousness for hosts in the I compartment : numeric}

\item{g}{: rate at which a person leaves the I compartment : numeric}

\item{f}{: strength of intervention effort between 0 and 1 : numeric}

\item{tstart}{: time at which intervention effort starts : numeric}

\item{tend}{: time at which intervention effort ends : numeric}

\item{tmax}{: maximum simulation time : numeric}
}
\value{
This function returns the simulation result as obtained from a call
  to the deSolve ode solver.
}
\description{
Simulation of a basic SIR compartmental model with these compartments:
  Susceptibles (S), Infected/Infectious (I),
  Recovered and Immune (R).
  
  The model is assumed to be in units of months when run through the Shiny App.
  However as long as all parameters are chosen in the same units, 
  one can directly call the simulator assuming any time unit.
}
\details{
A compartmental ID model with several states/compartments
  is simulated as a set of ordinary differential
  equations. The function returns the output from the odesolver as a matrix,
  with one column per compartment/variable. The first column is time.
}
\section{Warning}{

  This function does not perform any error checking. So if you try to do
  something nonsensical (e.g. negative values or fractions > 1),
  the code will likely abort with an error message.
}

\examples{
  # To run the simulation with default parameters just call the function:
  result <- simulate_idcontrolmultioutbreak_ode()
  # To choose parameter values other than the standard one, 
  # specify the parameters you want to change, e.g. like such:
  result <- simulate_idcontrolmultioutbreak_ode(S = 2000, I = 10, tmax = 100, g = 0.5)
  # You should then use the simulation result returned from the function, like this:
  plot(result$ts[ , "time"],result$ts[ , "S"],xlab='Time',ylab='Number Susceptible',type='l')
